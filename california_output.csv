Subject:	California Update--0717.01

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an ""informational"" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

1	1.0	0.6261	customer, market, utility, rate, cost, retail, consumer, electricity, demand, deregulation	"California's power crisis has generated heated debate over the last several months.  Unfortunately, this debate has generated more heat than light.  We want you to know what the facts are and what we are doing about the crisis.  Please spend a few minutes reading the following overview on the situation and our position on California energy issues.

What happened in California

The source of California's current problem is as straightforward as supply and demand.  California's economy grew 29 percent since 1998.  This increased the demand for electricity by 24 percent.  At the same time, regulatory restrictions prevented new generation from getting built in the state.  So demand grew but regulations prevented supplies from being added.  The result, predictably, is a shortage.  This summer, peak capacity will be about 10 percent shy of peak demand, leading to further blackouts in the state.

In addition to the supply and demand imbalance, there are two other related factors that led to the current crisis.  First, the state's regulations forced all sales and purchases into the spot market.  The spot market for power is extraordinarily volatile.  The way firms behave in a free market when faced with such volatility is to construct a portfolio of purchases long term, medium term and short term, to reduce exposure to this volatility.  In California, state regulation prevented this strategy.  This would be the equivalent of putting the entire state on an adjustable rate mortgage in the most volatile interest rate environment imaginable.  Everything was fine while the power surplus persisted, but when shortages ensued, every megawatt was purchased at the sky rocketing spot price.

Second, retail markets were not deregulated.  Regulated retail rates remained in effect, and stranded cost recovery charges were structured to keep competition out.  This meant that utilities were forced to pay high wholesale prices in the spot market but were only able to recover costs at the regulated retail rate.  They are now nearly bankrupt.

In short, California's problems were caused by regulation, not deregulation.  Regulations prevented competitors from entering the market, prevented new generation from being built, and prevented prudent hedging against volatile spot prices.

At the time California was developing its restructuring plan, Enron warned the state's policy makers about these risks and proposed alternatives, which, if adopted, would have averted the current crisis.

Enron's Role

Many political leaders in the state have elected to fix blame rather than fix the problem.  Power sellers, including Enron, have been vilified by the politicians and the media.  Here are the facts:

?	Other than a small amount of wind power, Enron is not a generator in the state of California.  Every megawatt we sold in California we bought in the same market available to other California purchasers.  Because we are a market maker, not a generator, we are not biased toward high prices.  We are interested only in having a market that works so that we can package products for our customers.
?	As a seller to end-use markets in the state, we provided protection from the problems the states' utilities, and their customers, now face.  We protected, and still protect, our customers from price volatility.

You may have read that EES recently elected to have the utilities supply power directly to its customers in California instead of procuring power on the open market.  Early reports mischaracterized this as a ""turnback"" of our customers to the utilities.  Here are the facts:

?	As a result of a variety of factors existing in the current California market, it made more sense for EES to source power for its customers directly from the utilities.  This decision reduced EES's market price risk by allowing EES to access lower utility rates.
?	EES did not terminate any customer contracts, and our customers continue to receive the financial benefits of their contract prices.
?	EES is continuing to work with its California customers to provide them with other energy-related products and services, including assistance in reducing the demand for power, particularly at peak times.

Enron is currently proposing solutions to help California work out of its crisis; Enron continues to sign up customers in the state; and Enron continues to actively manage its risks and capture opportunities in Western power markets.  Enron's primary business is managing risk for our customers with solutions customized to meet their needs.  There has never been more demand for our products and services.

The Solution

The solution to California's crisis is also straightforward.  In summary, the state must increase supply, reduce demand, reduce reliance on the spot market and shore up the financial stability of the state's utilities.

Increasing Supply

California's process for siting and permitting new generation is nothing short of Byzantine.  Enron has built plants elsewhere in the country in less than a year.  In California, it often takes 5 to 7 years.  California simply must streamline this process.  Ironically, while many of the regulations generators must overcome are aimed at improving environmental quality, the regulations are preventing new clean technology from coming online and displacing current plants, which emit 40 times as much NOx.  California can have abundant power and cleaner air by expediting the permitting of new facilities.

Reducing Demand

Customers in California today have no incentive to reduce or shift demand.  They pay the same rate no matter what the market price is.  An open retail market would trigger demand responses, which would balance supply and demand at lower prices than today.  California should fully open its retail market.

Reducing Reliance on the Spot Market

In a truly deregulated market, customers would protect themselves from volatile spot prices by purchasing some of their requirements on a longer term, fixed-price basis.  The state has instead left procurement in the hands of the utilities, which it has forced to buy exclusively in the spot market.  Opening the market at the retail level will give customers control over their price risk.

Restoring the Financial Integrity of the State's Institutions

The utilities in California are not paying their bills.  This has led to greater uncertainty in the market, higher costs, and reduced flexibility to arrive at lasting solutions.  California must permit its utilities to recover their costs so they can pay their bills and invest in the transmission and distribution assets necessary to get power from where it is to where it is needed.

Just as important as doing these things, the state must avoid policies that, while politically attractive, do not fix the problem or even make matters worse.  Price caps have been proposed.  They don't work; have never worked; and they will not work here.  Price caps succeed only in creating shortages, which then have to be allocated among competing users.  Imagine how ineffectively the government would be in determining, for example, whether it is better to make its limited power supplies available to the Imperial Valley or Silicon Valley.  Price caps are a surefire way to make the current shortage worse.

The state has also proposed to take over generation and transmission in California.  There is no reason to believe, and every reason to doubt, that the state will be more effective than free markets at investing in, constructing, operating and maintaining assets.  This will also result in California tax revenues being spent on power transmission and power generation -- which the private sector can do -- instead of education, roads and other public goods -- which the private sector cannot do.

As you are approached by people outside the company or are learning about the crisis from the media, it's important for you to know this:  We at Enron will continue to serve our customers and we will continue to propose real solutions to the state.  "

Mitchell, Stockton, Defense Lead Longhorns
Past Raiders; Applewhite Hurts Other Knee

It was a game of surges, weather wise and on the football field, Saturday
night in Lubbock and Texas triumphed, 29-17, because the Longhorns had two
surges and Texas Tech had only one.
The Longhorns dominated the first quarter  an d most of the second in cold,
rainy, sold-out Jones Stadium, coming out smoking offensively for the first
time all season.
Midway through the second quarter, Texas was ahead, 16-0, and seemingly on
the way to an easy win. But Texas Tech scored 10 points before intermission,
then scored again early in the second half to take a 17-16 lead.
Despite losing QB Major Applewhite to a knee injury (the right one, not the
surgically repaired left one), the Longhorns roared back to score the game's
final 13 points to claim the victory and stay alive in the Big 12 title chase.
Coach Mack Brown said an MRI was done on Applewhite's knee Sunday and he
hopes to know the results sometime Monday. He said he is hoping it is just a
sprain.
The Longhorn heroes were plentiful. Offensively, the entire line played
great, TB Hodges Mitchell was tremendous and Kris Stockton booted five field
goals and narrowly missed on a 55-yard attempt late in the first half.
Mitchell had 45 carries for 229 yards and scored both Longhorn touchdowns. He
also caught six passes for 38 yards.
Defensively, the Horns forced five turnovers, which the offense converted
into 20 points, and shut the Raider offense out for the final 25 minutes.
The victory gave Texas a 7-2 season record and 5-1 Big 12 mark, while Tech
fell to 6-4 overall and  2-4 in the Big 12.
If Texas A&M upsets Oklahoma this weekend, the Longhorns can tie the Sooners
for the Big 12 South title by beating Kansas and A&M to close the regular
season.
By virtue of their win over the Horns, the Sooners would represent the South
in the title game, but the tie and a 9-2 record would land the Longhorns in a
top bowl game.
The Longhorns have won four games in a row after a slow start this season.
Here, briefly, is how the game went:
FIRST QUARTER
The Longhorns moved the ball all over the field in the first quarter and took
a 10-0 lead. They got the ball first and drove 69 yards to the Tech 5, with
Mitchell getting all of the yardage on six tough runs behind good blocking
and a 1-yard pass reception. But the drive stalled and Stockton kicked a
23-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 11:08 left. Tech went three plays and
out, and Mitchell led another Longhorn drive that went 62 yards for a
touchdown and a 10-0 lead with 6:18 left. He carried four times for 35 yards,
including a 5-yard burst over right tackle for the TD. Applewhite also hit
freshman TE Brock Edwards for 18 yards during the drive. With the aid of two
penalties against UT, the Raiders drove to the Texas' 11, and QB Kliff
Kingsbury hit WR Tim Baker at the 5, but Baker fumbled and the Horns
recovered and were on the move again when the quarter ended.
SECOND QUARTER
The  drive that started at the Texas 5 stalled at the TT 30, but Stockton's
47-yard field goal gave UT a 13-0 leadwith 12:54 left. UT safety Greg Brown's
interception of a long Kingsbury pass killed Tech's next effort, but Texas
couldn't move and punted for the first time. Kingsbury, operating out of the
shotgun, bobbled a low snap and UT CB Ahmad Brooks fell on the loose ball at
the Raiders' 16. The Horns picked up a first down at the 4, but Mitchell was
stopped for no gain and two passes were incomplete, so Stockton kicked a
22-yard field goal for a 16-0 lead with 9:06 left. But the Raiders came right
back and Kingsbury hit WR Carlos Francis for a 39-yard touchdown strike that
cut the UT lead to 16-7 with 7:34 remaining. Texas had to punt   and Tech,
aided by a pass interference penalty, drove to the UT 11 before settling for
a 28-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 16-10 with 5:34 left. Applewhite
was sacked and fumbled on UT's next possession, giving the Raiders great
field position at the Texas 33. But the Longhorn defense held and a 49-yard
field goal try fell short. UT drove to the Tech 38, but Stockton's 55-yard
field goal try  just missed to the left in the final 30 seconds of the half.
THIRD QUARTER
Tech got the ball to start the half, but couldn't mount a drive. But
Applewhite's  pass was picked off by Tech DB John Norman, who ran it back to
the UT 14. Kingsbury got 13 yards on a QB draw, which was the longest Raider
run of the game, and Ricky Williams went over the top for the final yard. The
extra point put Tech on top, 17-16, with 10:35 left. But that lead was short
lived. Starting from their 25, the Longhorns drove to the Tech 18 before
Applewhite was sacked on a third-down play. He came up limping and never
returned to the game. Stockton booted a 36-yard field goal to put Texas back
on top, 19-17, with 6:07 left. The Raiders went three plays and out and so
did the Longhorns, but Stockton's punt was fumbled at the Tech 18 and Michael
Ungar recovered for the Horns. Behind great blocking, Mitchell ran for 8,
then for the final 10 and the TD that gave Texas a little breathing room at
26-17, with 2:07 left. The Raiders were driving as the quarter ended.
FOURTH QUARTER
DE Cole Pittman sacked Kingsbury on the first play of the quarter and CB
Roderick Babers intercepted Kingsbury's pass two plays later and ran it back
23 yards to the Tech 45. Mitchell carried fiv e times fror 25 yards and
Simms, under a big rush, found Johnson for 9 yards. But a penalty set the
Horns back and Stockton came in to boot his fifth field goal, a 32-yarder, to
put the Horns on top, 29-17, with 9:54 left. The Raiders killed most of the
clock with a long drive that came up empty. They drove from their own 20 to
the UT 33 so slowly and laboriously that the clock ran from 9:54 to 4:01 by
the time their fourth-down pass sailed incomplete. The drive would have ended
much earlier, but for two strange penalties against the Horns. One was a late
offside call after UT recovered a fumble and the other was a personal foul on
UT DE Cory Redding after he sacked Kingsbury. The officials said the foul was
a blow to the head, but Redding didn't appear to hit him in the head. At any
rate, after the fourth-down play failed, Mitchell carried six straight times
for 28 yards and two first downs to run out the rest of the clock.

Coach's Corner

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday QB Major Applewhite's knee injury Saturday night
does not appear to be as serious as the one he suffered in the Cotton Bowl
game against Arkansas.
The injury to Applewhite's left knee in the Cotton Bowl required surgery to
repair a torn ACL (anterier cruciate ligament.
Brown said the injury to his right knee Saturday in Lubbock might be just a
sprain. ""I'm not a doctor, so I don't know,"" he said. ""We're having an MRI
done today, and we'll know more tomorrow.""
But Applewhite had to be taken off the field on a stretcher in the Cotton
Bowl and he was standing on the sideline with Brown at the end of the Texas
Tech game.
""We were standing on the sideline at the end of the game,"" Brown said. ""He
walked off the field with me. He was upbeat and excited about the game. It
sure didn't look like what happened to him in the Arkansas game.""
He said Chris Simms played well in relief and he said the fact that Simms
played as much as he did early this season is a big plus if Applewhite's
injury turns out to be serious.
""Chris progresses every time he walks out on the field,"" Brown said. ""He put
a tremendous amount of pressure on himself early in the season. I felt like
last night was the most comfortable he has been.""
""There is no doubt in our minds that Chris is more ready to play now than he
was at the first of the season,"" Brown said.
Simms threw only two passes and he completed both of them. As he said, ""my
main job was pitching to Hodges left and pitching to Hodges right.""
With Hodges Mitchell rushing for 229 yards and 45 carries (both career highs)
and the line opening huge holes, that was the Longhorn offense for most of
the night.
Brown also said he probably wouldn't take the redshirt off freshman QB Chance
Mock if Applewhite's injury is serious. ""We'll talk about that. I'd think
right now we'd play Beau Trahan.""
Brown said freshman TE Brock Edwards ""played really well,"" and he said DT
Casey Hampton, DEs Cory Redding and Kalen Thornton, LB De'Andre Lewis and DBs
Quentin Jammer, Rod Babers and Greg Brown played well, too. He said LB Tyrone
Jones ""had by far his best game.""
He also said the offensive line ""played great and Hodges did a great job of
picking his holes. We've shown the ability in the last four games to throw it
or run it. We couldn't do that earlier in the year.""
Brown said the five Tech turnovers were a great credit to the UT defense, and
he said, ""I'm really proud of the offense to, with four minutes left, take it
and drive it on the ground and run out the clock. I've alway said you need to
be able to run the ball in the fourth quarter to win.""

Owens, Thomas Lead Horns

Junior 6-9 forward Chris Owens had 27 points and 14 rebounds and 6-8 freshman
forward James Thomas had 25 points and nine rebounds to lead the Longhorn
basketball team to a 92-81 exhibition victory over Team Ezybonds of Australia
before 2,305 fans at the Frank Erwin Center Sunday night.
""I think, for the most part, we played hard tonight,"" Texas coach Rick Barnes
said.  ""I think our guys realize that with being such a young team, you have
to go through some growing pains.  Our defense was not good tonight.  We got
hurt in transition defense and by dribble penetration, so we'll obviously
have to work on those things.""
Owens scored his 27 points on 11-of-22 shooting in just 28 minutes of work,
while Thomas went 10-of-16 from the floor. Junior swingman Maurice Evans
added 13 points on 5-of-13 shooting, while junior point guard Fredie Williams
had five points, seven assists andseven steals.
Texas concludes its exhibition season with a home game against EA Sports
California All-Stars Wednesday at 7 p.m. at the Erwin Center.
The Longhorns open the 2000-01 regular season when they host Navy on Monday,
Nov 13 in the opening round of the Preseason NIT at 7 p.m. at the Erwin
Center.

Dillard, Freshmen Sparkle

Sophomore guard Tai Dillard led six Longhorn players in double figures with a
team-high 16 points, plus seven assists and eight steals to pace the Texas
women's basketball team to a 91-56 victory over Spartak-Moscow in exhibition
game action at the Center Thursday night.
Texas never trailed in the contest, jumping out to a 12-0 lead in the first
2:56 of the game.  UT was aided  by seven Spartak-Moscow turnovers in that
span.
Spartak-Moscow, which opened a two-week exhibition swing through the states
of Texas and Louisiana against the Longhorns, committed 36 turnovers, 19 of
which came in the first half. Texas had 22 steals in the game, while
Spartak-Moscow had 13.
Joining Dillard in double-figure scoring were sophomore guard Alisha Sare,
who had 13 points and hit three 3-pointers, and freshman forward Annissa
Hastings and junior forward Tracy Cook, who each added 12 points. Senior
guard JoRuth Woods finished with 11 points, while freshman forward Stacy
Stephens scored 10 points..
""We'll need to spend some time looking at the videotape of this game, because
everything that could happen in a basketball game happened here tonight,""
said Texas head coach Jody Conradt. ""I think we started strong, pushing the
ball up the floor which was good, but then the game was too easy at the
start, and we got into a lull.""

Injury Update

Coach Mack Brown said Sunday reserve CB Ervis Hill suffered a separated
shoulder and will miss the Kansas game, but he said OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes
played most of the Texas Tech game without having any shoulder problems.
Kirk-Hughes' shoulder had been popping out, but Brown said he was encouraged
that he went through an entire game without problems.
He also said DT Shaun Rogers played without reinjuring his ankle.
Redshirt freshman DT Ryan Haywood underwent shoulder surgery Wednesday and is
out for the remainder of the season.
Brown said Haywood had a high school shoulder injury that flared up again
this year.
He said the surgery should eliminate the problem, and he said Haywood might
be available for part or possibly all of spring practice.

Texas No. 19, Favored by 13

Texas is No. 19 this week in both the Associated Press and USA Today
football polls and the Longhorns are favored over Kansas by 13 points for
their Saturday ame in Lawrence.
Other Big 12 teams in the AP poll are Oklahoma, the nation's only remaining
undefeated team, at No. 1, followed by Nebraska at No. 4, Kansas State at No.
16 and Texas A&M at No. 23.

AMCC'S Mekong IC Enables End-to-End OC-192 System Solutions for Next-Generation Intelligent Optical Network EquipmentMekong Represents AMCC's Latest Generation of Oc-192 Framer Technology With Integrated Features Targeted Specifically for the Optical Networking and DWDM Equipment Markets   SAN DIEGO, Jun 4, 2001 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Applied Micro Circuits Corp. (AMCC) (Nasdaq:AMCC) today announced the availability of the Mekong (S19204), the industry's first highly integrated OC-192 SONET/SDH framing and pointer processor device with on-chip features critical for next generation optical networking equipment.   Mekong is a multi-feature integrated circuit enabling customers to collapse multiple functions down to one chip, including aggregation, pointer processing and grooming functions. Mekong is complemented by AMCC's best-in-class CMOS Serializers/Deserializers (SERDES), Forward Error Correction (FEC) devices and switch fabric devices, to provide an end-to-end chip set solution (See figure 1) that meets the power, cost and space requirements of new intelligent optical networking equipment.   ""Mekong's ability to re-map section and line overhead or transparently pass-thru all TOH (Transport Overhead) bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes), with pointer processing enabled, on incoming SONET/SDH signals enables intelligent optical networking equipment to provide performance monitoring and support switching/routing decisions on incoming fibers. This can all be done while providing full transparent processing of client interfaces over private DWDM networks and public networks,"" said Mark Donovan, AMCC's Mekong senior product marketing manager. ""By designing the device to interface seamlessly with AMCC's popular OC-48 transceiver and OC-192 SERDES and 10G digital wrapper/FEC solutions, we're further contributing to the company's overall system solution approach and reducing our customer's time-to-market.""   Mekong also supports a variety of line interfaces for reducing system and board design requirements. For OC-48 interfaces Mekong supports 4-bit wide 622 Mbits/s interfaces, to enable seamless connections to AMCC's S3455 SERDES device. For OC-192 applications, Mekong provides 16-bit 622 Mbits/s interfaces for seamless connections to AMCC's 16-bit S3097/98 SERDES devices. Mekong's OC-192 interfaces are also designed for direct connection to AMCC's 10G digital wrapper/FEC Hudson device.   Mekong is AMCC's next generation framer/pointer processor device that enables the aggregation of four OC-48s into a larger OC-192 signal, or if used in conjunction with AMCC's Danube framer/pointer processor device, the aggregation of up to sixty-four OC-3s, sixteen OC-12s or logical combinations of OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48 asynchronous interfaces into a larger OC-192 signal (See figures 2 and 3). Mekong provides standard SONET/SDH pointer processing, and in addition, can transparently re-map the incoming OC-48 and OC-192 signals TOH across time domains and into the outgoing higher rate signal. Mekong also supports a pass-thru mode, where all TOH bytes (Standard and Reserved bytes) can be passed through Mekong, with pointer processing enabled, to enable full transparency across time domains. As a result, when AMCC's Danube is used in conjunction with Mekong, optical networking equipment vendors can offer service providers full transparency from OC-3 to OC-192 rates. Mekong can also perform the same functions in an OC-192-to-OC-192 mode.   Enabled by the device's two APS ports, Mekong provides protection switching and redundancy in both the multiplex and demultiplex directions and incorporates non-intrusive TOH monitoring for all inputs. The single-chip device features two built-in hitless Time Slot Interchange switches (TSIs), to provide STS-1 level traffic grooming, cross-connection, and add/drop applications. When used in conjunctions with AMCC's recently announced Zambezi, an 80G STS-1 level switch fabric device, the Mekong/Zambezi solution can serve as the first and Nth stage switch elements in a N-stage Clos switch fabric architecture (See figure 4). Mekong also offers a provisional pointer processor bypass mode for STS-192-to-STS-192 operation (through-timing); both a full framer bypass (no frame regeneration) as well as a pointer processor bypass (frame regeneration enabled) are also provided. Mekong also supports large deksew buffers in the multiplex direction for STS-192c inverse multiplexing applications. A high-speed microprocessor interface is provided for configuration and monitoring. Mekong also supports POH (B3/J1/G1/C2) monitoring, Full TOH drop and insert ports and robust alarm monitoring functions to provide the highest in OC-192 SONET/SDH integration and functionality for optical and DWDM equipment.   ""Mekong's feature-rich architecture and flexibility allows for multiple use in DWDM, Metro DWDM, digital cross-connects, multi-service access switches and core switch platforms,"" said Neal Neslusan, AMCC's marketing director of transport products. ""It is well suited for Optical-Electrical-Optical (OEO) switching applications where grooming wavelengths from the optical network and supporting electrical SONET/SDH signal switching is required.""   Pricing and Availability  The Mekong (S19204) is scheduled for sampling to development partners in August, with volume production scheduled for Q4 2001. Packaged in a 624 CBGA, the device is priced at $775.00 in volume quantities.

> be obtaining documents from the ISO and PX and we will not attempt here to
> duplicate documents that we understand will be produced by those entities.
> As you will see in the general documents that are offered here for

> Energy Services, Inc. and does not have operating authority or engage in
> wholesale or retail purchases or sales of energy.  Thus, the documents
> offered here with respect to those two entities originates with Enron
> Energy Services, Inc. but we have designated them both as EES.  We also do
> not propose to offer duplicative documents as between the Enron Entities.
>
> GENERAL DOCUMENTS
> Requests 1 through 4
>
>  Because of the dynamic nature of the Enron Entities' businesses, the

> One Enron Entity, Portland General, has published books on its corporate
> history.  If a list of those books would be helpful, we can provide it.
> With respect to the other Enron Entities, to the extent that corporate
> histories can be found, they will be produced.  We anticipate producing

>
> Requests 5 and 6
>
>  The Enron Entities propose that their responses to Requests 1-4 will
> identify their relationship to affiliated companies and the Transaction
> Documents will identify its customers and suppliers.  We believe this
> information will be sufficient to illustrate these relationships for the
> staff's purposes.
>
> FINANCIAL DOCUMENTS
> Requests 7 through 11
>
>  The Enron Entities will produce their public filings for the period

> Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.
>
> GENERATING DOCUMENTS
> Requests 12, 14 and 18
>
>  For the Enron Entities other than Portland General, the generation
> facilities are either non-existent or limited in number and there will
> probably be limited documents available.  The Enron Entities to the extent
> they act as a scheduling coordinator or possessed the right to use or
> resell generation output, do not have the specific documents that pertain
> to each generation unit requested.  The Enron Entities, other than
> Portland General, do have documents and information for Las Vegas
> Cogeneration.  We propose to produce these documents in the second wave of
> document productions.
>
>   For Portland General, the production of the requested documents
> would involve a tremendous volume of documents, as Portland General owned
> twenty generating facilities of a variety of types and sizes during 2000.
> Portland General is a net importer of energy and can only generate about
> one half of its total energy demand.  As a result, we question whether the
> effort required of Portland General is warranted as its impact on the
> California wholesale market is necessarily limited.  Nevertheless,
> Portland General proposes to provide for year 2000 electronic Transaction
> Documents in summary form similar to the data being provided by other
> Enron Entities, to the extent relevant as discussed below.  We propose
> that the Commission defer requesting production of other information until
> it has reviewed the information of generators who sell a significant
> proportion of their energy into the California market.  At that time a
> more accurate assessment can be made of whether this enormous effort will
> be valuable given the limited impact of Portland General generation on the
> California wholesale market.
>
> TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
> Requests 13, 15, 16, 17 and 19
>
>  We understand that the Commission will be obtaining trading data for
> the purchase and sale of energy delivered in California from the ISO and
> PX.  EPMI can provide the Commission several different sets of relevant
> transaction data for year 2000 (in California and outside of California
> and Real Time) for the purchase and sale of energy delivered with the
> date, counterparty, quantity, delivery point, hours, price, and whether it
> is a purchase or a sale.   Because of the speed with which you want this
> information, it is possible that some entries will be incomplete or
> inaccurate.  For those
> transactions where EPMI served only as the scheduling coordinator, we
> understand that the ISO will show part of the transaction, but there will
> not be a corresponding transaction in the EPMI data we can provide
> quickly.  The reason is that this type of transaction is passed through to
> EPMI's customer on an accounting system rather than as part of the trading
> business.  EES can also provide similar data with respect to relevant
> wholesale and retail transactions with the proviso that with respect to
> retail transactions it will not include the specific names of its retail
> customers but instead will provide a blind customer number due to EES'
> confidentiality obligations to those customers.  We anticipate producing
> the Transaction Documents in the second wave of document productions.
>
> FERC DOCUMENTS
>
> Request 20
>
>  The Enron Entities will produce the requests for data they received
> from FERC and to the extent that FERC has been given responses, copies of
> those responses.  We anticipate producing the FERC documents on October
> 13, 2000.
>
>
>  Based upon discussions that we have had with the various Enron
> Entities, we believe that we could make a second wave of productions on
> Friday October 27, 2000.  It is possible that not all Enron Entities could
> make that date but we believe the bulk of the data could be available for
> production by then.
>
>  We propose to make these productions with the understanding that if
> any entity obtains a more stringent protective order than the one
> currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document productions
> will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In addition,
> if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding, the
> Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
> for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities
> reserve the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with
> such order.
>

World Bank reported that pension reform is becoming an increasingly
important global issue for developing and high-income countries. Many
countries have basic pension plans in place; however, most only cover 10% to
30% of the working population and impose a heavy strain on economic
development. The World Bank favors a multi-pillar pension plan consisting of
minimal contribution by the lifetime poor, access to various financial
instruments for the large informal sector, and a diversified sector for
formal workers.  <mailto:david.w.ellis@bakernet.com>

of the five exceptions stipulated in ILO Convention 29 concerning the
prohibition of forced labour. The issue, which is at the top of the agenda
at the current ILO annual conference, is also the subject of a new ICFTU

business. In the first case of its kind, the victim's family sought to

this case did not have a internal policy on cell-phone use. Cases such as

2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that Saturn
Corporation violated the Americans With Disabilities Act by placing an
employee on disability status who had failed to physically perform all of
the functions assigned to his team. Saturn Corporation relies on a team
system in which workers performing related functions rotate duties among
themselves. Jeffrey Kiphart filed suit against Saturn, alleging some Saturn
workers were allowed to choose the team jobs that they performed and he was
not. See "" Kiphart v. Saturn

involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock 
they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.

The Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed 
late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of 
interest involving their official duties and personal finances. 
A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, 
according to state records.
All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator 
whose stock they owned. 
In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from 
her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential 
conflicts was handled. 
Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the 
conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file 
required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which 
included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants ""may have 
crossed the line,"" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. 
State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their 
personal financial interests. 
Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could 
undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most 
influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements 
that led to the firings. 
Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in 
promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state 
bond sale in U.S. history. 
The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman 
have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the 
$12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The 
companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through 
with the purchase of utility transmission lines. 
Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a 
separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political 
reform laws. Critics question the distinction. 
""The governor's approach may be convenient for him,"" said Jim Knox, executive 
director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, ""but it ignores the 
law."" 
Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that ""decisions are 
not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,"" Knox said. ""Trying 
to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to 
be doing."" 
The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding 
the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration 
as it rushed into the power trading business this year. 
More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according 
to state records. 
In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government 
ethics laws. 
It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even 
basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The 
state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly 
within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. 
Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the 
circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key 
information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to 
state when they bought the energy stocks. 
One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of 
interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a 
Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the 
governor of ""a conscious policy of secrecy"" in enforcing compliance with 
public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and 
Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 
4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine 
The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San 
Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 
billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from 
several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. 
While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said 
they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More 
than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine 
in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records 
available. 
""We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these 
stocks,"" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an 
interview. 
The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a 
$500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power 
and negotiating contracts, records show. 
A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility 
District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed 
owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had 
participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could 
not be reached for comment. 
The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, 
Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be 
reached Friday by The Times. 
All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a 
now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early 
days of California's electricity deregulation. 
Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts 
calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, 
including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern 
California. 
Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him 
that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the 
stock a week ago. 
He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and 
saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value 
each time. 
Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team 
Thursday and fired. 
""I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't 
give me an answer,"" Mead said. ""[He] just said your services are terminated. 
""I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the 
lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger 
pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and 
we're the pawns."" 
Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other 
traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work 
for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power 
Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after 
disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office 
said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. 
Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, 
in her final days working at the electricity exchange. 
A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal 
to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. 
On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state 
and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. 
One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. 
The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power 
for up to 20 years. 
In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others 
reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And 
two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility 
that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. 
Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power 
plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after 
deregulation. 
Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, 
said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly 
before he began work for the state Feb. 28. 
Purchase of Enron Stock Defended 
""I don't see a conflict,"" he said. ""At the time, we weren't really dealing 
with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron."" 
Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict 
until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or 
lose his job. 
That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. 
""We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the 
highest ethical standards,"" he wrote. ""That standard is not met by those who 
hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on 
behalf of the state on energy related matters."" 
""Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must 
divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she 
refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person."" 
However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with 
his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. 
Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la 
Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state 
Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not 
have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not 
consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of 
projects. 
Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including 
the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters 
and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the 
record. 
Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, 
prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval 
of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. 
Pact Specifies Financial Advice 
The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to 
provide ""financial advisory services"" to the state. 
The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings 
stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and 
Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like 
the other two firms, it too was hired to provide ""financial advisory 
services"" to the state. 
That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the 
administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power 
company interests. 
The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a 
longer contract.

Calif DWR Seen Asking PUC To Order 25% Rate Increase Fri
By Jason Leopold

07/13/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
(This article was originally published earlier Friday.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California Department of Water Resources, the
agency purchasing a bulk of the state's power needs in lieu of the three
investor-owned utilities, is expected to tell state regulators Friday that
they need to increase electricity rates by as much as 25%.

This is because there are insufficient funds in the current revenue stream
to cover a $13.4 billion bond sale, three commissioners with the Public
Utilities Commission told Dow Jones Newswires late Thursday.

PUC President Loretta Lynch is expected to issue a draft decision Friday
either endorsing the rate hike request or calling for an audit of the DWR's
current revenue stream before she makes a decision, aides in her office
said.

If the PUC determines that there are not enough funds in the current rate
structure to cover the bond sale, it will have no choice but to order the
rate increase, according to the legislation that put the state in the power
buying business.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in just two months, if approved by the PUC, the commissioners
said.
""Back in May when we ordered the first rate increase, we said we may be
forced to do it again by the summer,"" one commissioner said.

""It's unfortunate, but it shouldn't be a shock to anyone. The state has
made an enormous commitment to Wall Street that rates would go up whenever
it's needed to ensure there is enough money to pay off those bonds.""

Lynch and a spokesman for the DWR were unavailable for comment late
Thursday.

Separately, Assembly Speaker Pro Tem Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, has
drafted a proposal expected to be introduced into the Assembly Friday or
Saturday that would have large businesses using the most electricity to
finance the bulk of the $43 billion in long-term power supply contracts,
aides in his office said.
Moreover, Keeley's plan is aimed at reducing rates for consumers who use
the least amount of power. Details of the plan are still sketchy, aides
said.

Possible Rate Hike To Generate $2.5B Yearly For State

The 50% rate increase ordered in May is expected to generate $5 billion
annually, and if the PUC orders a 25% increase, that is expected to
generate $2.5 billion. However, it is still unclear if that is enough, the
commissioners said.

Businesses are expected to bear most of the burden of the rate increase,
the second in four months, if approved by the PUC, the three commissioners
said.
Since January, the state has spent nearly $8.5 billion buying electricity
on behalf of customers of Edison International (EIX) unit Southern
California Edison, Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric and
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric.

The state has borrowed more than $7 billion from its general fund, which
must be repaid by ratepayers at 6% interest, to purchase power.

In addition, the state has locked itself into $43 billion in long-term
power supply contracts at high prices for as much as 20 years to ensure
there is enough power to meet demand. Future rate increases to finance the
contracts are likely, state officials have said.

But if the PUC orders another rate increase, the money won't benefit the
utilities, which have billions of dollars in power costs to recover.
Instead, it will be used to guarantee Wall Street financial institutions
that there is sufficient funds in the rate structure to allow $13.4 billion
in revenue bonds to be sold.

The bonds are expected to be sold in August or September, said state
Treasurer Phil Angelides.

The commissioners said the PUC and the DWR waited to address another rate
hike to see if state officials and generators were successful in coming to
terms on $8.9 billion the state says it was overcharged for power since
last year.

After two weeks of hearings between generators and a delegation of
California utility executives and energy officials, talks broke down
Monday. Generators offered the state $716 million in refunds, but Gov. Gray
Davis balked, threatening to sue to recover the full $8.9 billion.

Any refunds would have been disbursed to the utilities and the DWR, which
could have deferred the need for any rate increase, according to Steve
Maviglio, press secretary to Davis.

An administrative law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
said Thursday he will recommend that the commission not order cash refunds
to California because the state's utilities owe far more money to the
generators than what he thinks the state is owed.

			Good Friday Afternoon - Comments From The Local
Guys!

One of the reasons that we, the Local Guys are pretty exited about the
recent rate cut by the Federal Reserves is that we think it will make a real
difference. Over the last few months, there has been considerable talk that
while capital spending (especially information technology spending) has been
budgeted by corporations for 2001, it has, to a large extent, been 'frozen'
as the economic uncertainty had taken a grip of corporate comptrollers. We
believe that this latest rate cut  (and possible future cuts), could well
spur greater corporate confidence (as well as spur greater liquidity from
the capital markets) and thus free up already allocated budgets for
corporate spending.


The 30-year US T-Bond yield is 5.81%.
The 10-year yield is 5.30%.
The 5-year is trading at 4.81%.
Spot crude oil is trading at $28.03 p/b.

$18 per share using a conservative sum of parts valuation.
*Improving visibility-after yesterday's solid 1Q results, we are raising our
FY01 revenue estimates from $755 million to $763 million
and reducing our loss estimates from ($0.22) to ($0.16).
*Closing the credibility gap: results indicate that new management is
focused on delivering on expectations which should drive
multiple expansion.
*New cost cutting initiatives and new strategic sales hires in Europe & Asia
should drive NETA towards 4Q profitability and improve
2002 sales outlook.
*Sniffer product can provide upside potential to top-line numbers as

Cable Communications Services L. Warner, .202.452.4705
Cable 1Q01 Performance Should Turn Heads
*We believe 1Q01 results for the cable industry will serve as a major
catalyst for the group by reinforcing that new services growth
remains strong despite a slowing economy. As a result, cables revenue and
cash flow projections are not only intact, but may in fact
be conservative for 2001.
*We believe each of the cable operators will deliver new services net adds
between 3Q00 and 4Q00 levels with no signs of slowing
demand.
*As a result, revenue growth for 1Q01 will accelerate from 2000 levels by
100-200 basis points and is poised for 200-500 basis points
in acceleration by 4Q01.
*Cash flow growth in 1Q01 will represent the low water mark for the year
with 2H marking significant acceleration as new services
continue to scale and high speed data breaks even

market opens.
*We are looking for earnings of $0.50 p/s (+12.8% Y/Y) on revenue of $1.58
billion (+14.3% Y/Y). Consensus forecast is $0.51 p/s.
*We continue to believe Omnicom has the best growth prospects in the
industry based on powerful new business wins during '00 and
1Q01.
*We project organic growth of 13%-14% and modest 20 bps improvement in
operating margins.
*The primary focus will be on forward guidance as the U.S. ad market has
clearly weakened and we suspect some marketing services
are under pressure.
*OMC is up 12% over the past two weeks and now trades at 31.8x our '01 est.
We believe earnings upside will be needed to maintain

*As expected, eBay reported solid 1Q'01 results that were ahead of our
estimates.
*EPS came in at $0.11 ($0.03 better than our est which was in-line with
consensus) on revenue of $154 mm vs our estimate of $150
mm.
*Growth in key operating metrics was robust as well- gross merchandise sales
were up 72%YoY, registered users were up 135% YoY,
and auctions listed were up 66% YoY.
*We are increasing our 2001 revenue est. from $662 mm to $679 mm (up 58%
YoY) and maintaining EPS estimates for the next three
quarters.
*Despite these strong results, we continue to believe that at 136x 2001E
EPS, the risk reward of the stock is not favorable. We remain
concerned that new initiatives may struggle to take off and hold back
profitability.
*Given our concerns about growth and valuation, we are maintaining our 3
(Market Perform) rating.

INITIATING COVERAGE

Mkt Cap: $2.5B EPS 2002 N/A $0.94E N/A 17.0
FY: 6/30 Price Target N/A $21
Rank N 2
*We initiate coverage of KPMG Consulting shares with a 2-Buy rating and a
12-month price target of $21 per share, based on an
assumed multiple of 20 times our CY02 EPS estimate of $1.05 per share. KPMG
Consulting is one of the worlds largest consulting
and IT services firms and completed a $2.3 billion IPO in early February at
$18 per share.
*Yesterday after the close KPMG pre-announced in-line March quarter revenues
and headcount cuts of 5% of the workforce. We
expect EPS of 24 cents, just below current consensus of 25 cents. In our
view, these results will be viewed as a positive. Our CY01
EPS estimate of 90 cents and our CY02 estimate of $1.05 (up 16%) are
moderately below Street consensus. KPMG expects to report
after the close on May 1st.
*At $16 per share, KPMG Consulting shares trade at 18 times our CY01 EPS
estimate and 15 times our CY02 EPS estimate. In our
view this multiple is very fair but unlikely to rally near-term due to the
difficult market conditions and challenges faced by KPMG's
major alliance partners Oracle, SAP and Cisco.

Rank 2 2
*Post close yesterday, Nortel reported weak 1Q01 results following its
recent preannouncement. We consider NT's decision not to
provide guidance for FY01 & suggestion the usually seasonally stronger 2Q
could potentially below 1Q underlines ongoing weakness
in the service provider comm equipment market. We are once again lowering
our ests & see few n-term catalysts for shares at current
levels.
*Sales of $6.2B down 2%YoY reflected particular weakness in long haul
optical (-30% impacted by excess capacity/pricing) &
circuit switching with optical metro & wireless (+38% YoY) seeing solid
growth. US -23%, ROW +38%. Book to Bill 0.80.
*Gross margins down from 45.5% 4Q00 to 30.1% 1Q01 with n-term outlook
uncertain, announced further 5,000 job cuts now @
20,000 in total. Bal sheet broadly intact, slight QoQ decline in
receivables, inventories
*Ests Move to $0.05 in 01 & $0.50 in 02 from $0.25 & $0.60. 01 revs $27B

*MSFT beat our estimate by $200M and $0.02 with results of $6.4B and $0.44
EPS. The diff vs. our estimates was recognition of
$130M ($0.02) in deferred revs.
*Guidance for Q4 called for $6.4B and $0.42. FY02 estimates 12% topline
growth (about 2% better than expected) and 6% EPS
growth. We expect to see some operating margin pressure due to Windows XP
and XBox marketing blitzes.
*Overall the product line-up is strong, and the financial leverage to MSFT
apparent. But while unit growth still remains weak now, we
do expect a pick-up in seasonal PC shipments into the high single digit
range.
*To rationalize the current valuation, MSFT needs to get to 12-15% EPS
growth we believe they can achieve this going into the
holiday selling season. Given that the stock is up 10% in a week, and 40%
YTD, we would accumulate on weakness knowing that it
will be a slow summer.

FY: 6/30 Price Target $40 $40
Rank 1 1
*Yesterday Sun reported 3Q01 results, with revs below our ests., and EPS
in-line. Sun faced a trying quarter, with a combination of
several pressures weighing in, including tough comps & weak US demand. The
quarter was disappointing, with the shorter-term
outlook still tenuous. Nonetheless, looking out to CY02, our belief is that
several catalysts can drive Sun to renewed momentum.
These include U-III portfolio of products, storage, Internet Infrastructure,
iPlanet and Cobalt-based products. While worldwide IT
spending upturn may be a few quarters away, in our view, Sun's shares are
among those to own once the cycle turns. We continue to
view Sun as well-positioned and maintain our 1-Strong Buy rating.
*Due to near term uncertainty, we are reducing our current estimates. For
4Q01, we are estimating revs to decline by 16.9% and EPS
at $0.05, down 75%, making FY01 ests.17.2% rev growth and EPS at $0.44. In
FY02, we are lowering our rev growth est. to 15.1%
and EPS est. to $0.52.

FY: 12/31 Price Target $48 $48
Rank 3 3
*Although 1Q01 EPS of $1.00 (vs. $1.06 a yr. ago) was above our $0.88 est.,
TXT lowered its EPS guidance for the yr. and now
expects EPS for 2001 at $4.65, flat with 2000 levels vs. its previous 5%
growth forecast. Textron expects 2Q01 EPS to be about
$1.10, down 11% from last year. We are keeping our 2001 est. at $4.05 and
maintain our cautious 3 Market Perform rating. We
believe investors are too complacent about the negative impact of the weak
economy on TXT's businesses.
*Aircraft results improved in 1Q01 vs. last yr. However this is the first
qtr. since '98 where backlog at Cessna dropped on a sequential
basis. Backlog at Bell declined for the 5th consecutive qtr. These trends
support our cautious view on the segment although the
current backlog is still quite strong.
*Automotive sales were down 19% & profits dropped 25%. Fastening Systems
sales declined 14% with profits down 19%. Results in
these segments were essentially in-line with our expectations. Textron
Financial revenues were below our expectations, but profits
were higher than our forecast.

us and $0.05 above consensus (less than the $0.13
surprise of F1Q01). The quarter was strong, but the 2H jackpot won't be as
large as it: 1) will not have the pricing spike of 1Q, 2)
has no unit growth (vs. +43% in 1H), and, 3) has less demand from Native
Americans in California. In addition, we remain
unconvinced that cashless will accelerate replacement. With a historically
high valuation despite earnings growth deceleration, we
maintain our 3-Market Perform rating.
*Better than expected pricing was responsible for the $0.05 upside surprise.
IGT expressed comfort with the high end of consensus for
2001. We are upping our estimates to reflect the surprise and somewhat less
conservative pricing assumptions, though we forecast
pricing below the spiked level of F2Q01.
*Unit growth will no longer provide a boost to earnings, as production of

*IDEC quarter consistent with pre-announced numbers. We are adjusting our

*IDEC reported 1Q 2001 EPS of $0.12 per share, representing a profit of
$20.8 million. This was consistent with the numbers pre-announced
on April 12th.
*Sales for lead product Rituxan were $168 million in the 1st quarter, making
it the fourth consecutive impressive quarter for the drug.
*IDEC management confirmed that it expects to receive a Complete Review

*Our EPS forecasts are at $0.52, $0.67, and $0.82 per share in the years
2001-2003, down from $0.55, $0.77 and $0.86. Our EPS
changed because of reductions in our Zevalin forecast and increases in our

Davis to push backup diesel
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 24, 2001) 
In a major reversal of environmental policy, Gov. Gray Davis will announce a 
plan to relieve California's overloaded electricity grid this summer by 
paying businesses to run their high-polluting backup generators in advance of 
anticipated blackouts, a top energy adviser to the governor said Wednesday. 
""The backup generators will help us get through the summer,"" said S. David 
Freeman, who recently resigned as general manager of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power to lead Davis' drive for energy conservation. 
Freeman said he would leave it to Davis to disclose details of the plan. 
""The governor will announce what he's going to do,"" he said Wednesday in a 
wide-ranging interview on energy issues with The Bee. 
Roger Salazar, the governor's deputy press secretary, would not confirm when 
or whether Davis would make such an announcement. 
""I don't know that the governor has signed off on anything like that,"" 
Salazar said. 
Under the plan, participating businesses would turn on backup generators and 
simultaneously disconnect from the electricity grid when power supplies are 
at Stage 3 -- nearly depleted. 
The state would pay the companies for the much-needed power that would be 
saved by converting to diesel generation. 
Deploying diesel-powered generators -- the dirtiest of internal combustion 
engines -- to forestall blackouts is another sign of the governor's struggle 
to get more megawatts flowing through California. 
Earlier this week Davis lowered his estimate of the amount of new power that 
will come on line this summer from 5,000 megawatts to 4,000 megawatts. A 
megawatt is enough power for 750 to 1,000 households. 
The diesel plan also marks a significant turnabout in the Davis 
administration's policy. 
The governor and his appointees at the state Air Resources Board uniformly 
have rejected such proposals from industries, utilities and the operator of 
the state's electricity grid, arguing that routine use of the backup diesels 
would endanger public health. 
San Diego Gas & Electric has one such proposal scheduled for a vote today by 
the Davis-appointed state Public Utilities Commission. 
Environmentalists who have been catching word of the Davis plan this week 
argue that it would shatter the governor's repeated promises to stand firm on 
air quality standards during the energy crisis. 
A letter signed Wednesday by several of the state's leading environmental 
organizations, including the American Lung Association of California, urged 
Davis to reconsider. 
""Given your awareness of the public health threats of diesel emissions, 
please stop and have these proposals considered in a more thoughtful and 
public manner,"" the letter states. 
Freeman argued, however, that the additional health threat from non-emergency 
use of diesel generators is ""marginal"" compared with the health and safety 
problems triggered by power outages. 
""This is a no-brainer,"" Freeman said. ""You've got human lives at stake here. 
This is a scary situation."" 
Freeman cited, for example, people on life-support systems that could go awry 
in blackouts. 
But Sandra Spelliscy, attorney for the environmentalist Planning and 
Conservation League, countered, ""If the health impacts are so marginal, why 
has the governor's own air quality enforcement agency opposed this?"" 
Industries ranging from hospitals to food processing plants and data 
management centers have diesel-powered generators -- some the size of 
locomotives -- that kick on when a storm or earthquake knocks out power. 
Unlike diesel-powered trucks and buses, most diesel standby generators run 
with little or no pollution controls because they are intended only for 
emergencies. 
Though the latest models run cleaner and more efficiently, most generators in 
use today produce about 500 times more emissions of smog-forming nitrogen 
oxides per megawatt-hour as a new natural gas-fired power plant, according to 
air board engineers. Further, the diesels spew high amounts of breathable 
soot particles that can cause cancer, the engineers say. 
Davis' plan would limit the use of the generators to days when the grid 
operator declares a Stage 3 alert, meaning the power supplies are running low 
and rolling blackouts may be ordered to keep the state's entire grid from 
collapsing, according to Freeman. 
Salazar, the governor's spokesman, said only, ""Any backup generation 
involving diesel will have to be used as a last resort to prevent blackouts."" 
Environmentalists who are trying to head off the plan said it would have the 
state paying participating businesses at least 35 cents per kilowatt-hour, 
roughly three times the rate consumers typically pay for electricity. Freeman 
would not confirm the pay rate. 
The Davis administration has offered generators willing to sell new power 
exclusively to the state 50 percent discounts on the air emission credits 
they would need to comply with smog rules. 
For operators of existing power plants, the governor has agreed to have 
taxpayers pay the entire cost of polluting above allowable limits in order to 
keep the lights on. 
The latest plan to pay companies to run the dirty diesels during energy 
alerts further loosens the environmental reins.

Bush-Davis meeting set for energy crisis
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
WASHINGTON -- President Bush will meet next week with Gov. Gray Davis to talk 
about California's worsening electricity crisis amid a shifting political 
dynamic on Capitol Hill that increasingly favors some controls on West Coast 
wholesale electricity prices. 
Details for the Bush-Davis meeting were still being worked out Wednesday, but 
the fact that the Republican president is meeting with the Democratic 
governor, who is often mentioned as a possible challenger in 2004, was seen 
as a sign that the White House is facing increasing political heat on the 
energy issue. 
""California is a very big state,"" said White House spokesman Ari Fleischer. 
""It represents one-sixth of the United States. It's the sixth-largest economy 
in the world. And the president is very pleased to sit and talk with Governor 
Davis. It's important."" 
Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, said electricity price caps will be at the 
top of the governor's agenda for the meeting on Tuesday or Wednesday. But 
Fleischer did not commit the president to that kind of meeting. 
In his first visit to the state since the campaign last year, the president 
will spend Monday night in Los Angeles and Tuesday night in Fresno. 
Until now, the White House has steadfastly refused to meet with any elected 
Democrat from California about the energy crisis despite repeated pleas from 
the Democratic congressional delegation. 
Price controls have become the mantra of California Democratic lawmakers and 
a handful of Republicans, but the Bush administration has flatly dismissed 
them as counterproductive to increasing power generation in the 
megawatt-short state. 
In recent weeks, however, there has been a developing shift in the attitude 
toward price controls on Capitol Hill. Bush's two nominees to the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, whose names were forwarded to the Senate floor 
Wednesday for confirmation, declined to rule out price controls once they are 
seated on the panel. 
And the apparent decision by Vermont Sen. James Jeffords to abandon the 
Republican Party would put Democrats in control of the Senate, moving Sen. 
Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico, a price-control advocate, to the helm of the key 
Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a committee Democrat, said Wednesday that 
she has talked to Bingaman and that he committed to moving her legislation to 
temporarily peg wholesale prices to the cost of production. 
Four Republican House members from California have also endorsed some form of 
price-control legislation. 
On Wednesday, Rep. Doug Ose, R-Sacramento, announced that he is introducing a 
bill that, while not technically a price cap, would give greater price relief 
for West Coast consumers than federal regulators or the Bush administration 
have been willing to offer. 
Ose, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee's energy subcommittee, 
said his bill would extend throughout the West a price-mitigation plan 
approved last month by the FERC. But instead of that plan taking effect only 
during power emergencies as the commission directed, it would operate around 
the clock under Ose's bill to peg spot market prices at the cost of 
production of the least-efficient plant selling into the California market. 
Ose said his bill would encourage generators to sell their power through 
long-term contracts rather than on the volatile spot market. 
""I am looking for a middle ground,"" Ose said.

Energy Digest: GOP unveils plan to help utility
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 24, 2001) 
State Assembly efforts to develop a bipartisan proposal to help Southern 
California Edison pay off massive debts and avoid bankruptcy hit a dead end 
Wednesday when Republicans released a plan of their own. 
The move could force Democrats to sidestep Republicans and vote along party 
lines on an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed $2.76 billion state 
purchase of power lines. 
Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks said Wednesday's split was 
necessary because there are few differences between the governor's plan and 
the Democrats' plan. 
The Republican plan rejects the notion of purchasing transmission lines or 
hydroelectric facilities. 
Key components call for dedicating a portion of consumer rates to allow 
Edison to pay off $3.5 billion in debts. In return, ratepayers would receive 
either an equity stake in future power plants or the right to purchase 
electricity at discount rates.






Few escape blame for crisis in poll
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 24, 2001) 
Utility companies and out-of-state power generators continue to get the 
lowest marks for their performance in California's energy crisis, but Gov. 
Gray Davis' grades have slipped dramatically over the past five months, 
according to a Field Poll released Wednesday. 
And Californians, it turns out, blame plenty of people for the state's power 
woes -- except themselves. 
Every player in the power drama gets poor marks except ""residential energy 
consumers,"" which 39 percent of poll respondents say are doing a good or very 
good job to improve the energy situation. Only 22 percent think they are 
doing a poor or very poor job. 
Public opinion of residential consumers' efforts has improved since January, 
when 32 percent thought they were doing a poor job and only 26 percent gave 
them high marks. 
""The public sees themselves as conserving energy,"" said Field Poll Director 
Mark DiCamillo. ""That's the only positive movement in the survey."" 
For Davis, who faces re-election next year, the movement is far from 
positive. 
In the January poll, the Democratic governor received good marks from 41 
percent of those surveyed, average grades from 31 percent and poor ratings 
from only 22 percent. 
But when the Field Institute conducted its recent poll between May 11 and 
Sunday, opinions about Davis flip-flopped. After months of energy angst, a 
handful of power blackouts and two rate increases, only 27 percent think 
Davis is doing a good job, while 38 percent gave him failing grades. The poll 
also shows that Californians believe the crisis will continue by an average 
of a year and a half, well through the upcoming re-election battle. 
""All the rhetoric Davis used with some positive effect early on is not going 
over well any more,"" DiCamillo said. ""The public is starting to view this as 
a long-term problem, not some temporary policy shift."" 
Still, Davis fares far better than his adversaries in the crisis -- President 
Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and the energy industry. 
The public's view of energy interests, which was pretty dim in January, drops 
even lower in the May poll. Utility companies received bad ratings from half 
the public in January, but 57 percent now believe they are doing a poor or 
very poor job. Out-of-state energy generators, whom Davis has accused of 
gouging ratepayers, fell from 44 percent low ratings in January to 55 percent 
in the May poll. 
Bush, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the state Public Utilities 
Commission are not far behind, drawing poor grades from more than half the 
public. Cheney, the architect of Bush's energy proposal, received low ratings 
from 43 percent. The January Field Poll did not ask about Bush and Cheney 
because they had not yet taken office. 
Davis has repeatedly bashed FERC for not imposing wholesale price caps on 
electricity, and has called Cheney ""grossly misinformed"" on the state's 
energy problems. Cheney, in turn, has called Davis' energy proposals 
""harebrained"" and ""goofy."" 
The state Legislature receives poor marks from 41 percent of those polled, 
while only 16 percent believe it is doing a good job.

New views emerging on power
More elected officials support the concept of planned blackouts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau 
(Published May 23, 2001)

If Californians are to be left in the dark, they should at least know when to 
break out the candles or send the workers home. 
That's the growing sentiment among a range of elected officials, including 
Gov. Gray Davis, who are pushing the idea of planning power blackouts and 
giving businesses and residents ample warning. 
On Tuesday, the Democratic governor's office said Davis supports longer 
public notice than the 24 hours called for under a proposal by the California 
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid. 
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, introduced a bill that would lay out a 
blackout schedule for the summer. Businesses could make plans for the 
possible blackout days and also be assured that on all other days the lights 
would stay on. 
Briggs called his plan an improvement on the existing system in which ""every 
day is a potential blackout day."" 
A Senate committee, meanwhile, discussed planned blackouts as part of a 
strategy to gain leverage over electricity generators by declaring that the 
state will not pay above a certain amount for power. The state would ask 
Washington and Oregon to join the so-called ""buyers' cartel."" 
If the power generators refused to sell at the lower prices, the state would 
gut it out with planned blackouts. 
""Let's use the blackouts against the generators,"" Michael Shames, head of the 
San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action Network, told the Energy, Utilities 
and Communications Committee. But Shames and others stressed the need for 
warnings of at least 12 hours and blackouts no longer than 90 minutes. 
""Absent that management of blackouts, we don't see how the buyers' cartel 
could work,"" Shames said. 
On a visit to Chicago on Monday, Davis said he talked to officials about the 
city's system for giving the public warning days before possible power 
blackouts, with definite notice right before. 
""There is no reason to keep that secret from the public when their safety is 
likely to be jeopardized,"" Davis told reporters Tuesday. The governor said he 
plans to meet in the next few days with managers at ISO to explore the idea 
of a system like Chicago's. 
The grid operator announced Monday that it will try to give the public at 
least a half-hour notice of outages, but many officials said Tuesday the 
public needs even more warning. Davis aides said the governor's plan will go 
beyond ISO's. 
There are potential pitfalls. Criminals might make their own plans, taking 
advantage of deactivated alarms. And some say that a schedule of blackouts 
might increase the number of outages. 
If people have been warned that a blackout is coming, and a last-minute 
supply of electricity makes it unnecessary, grid managers would have to 
decide whether to call it off, said Dorothy Rothrock, vice president of the 
California Manufacturers & Technology Association. 
If they did, it would add uncertainty to future warnings, she said, possibly 
leading them to order unnecessary blackouts. 
""Obviously, there are trade-offs,"" Rothrock said. 
Still, the idea of planning blackouts seems to be gaining ground as a way for 
the state to get back some control of the energy crisis, sorely lacking in 
recent months. 
""It would help us as Californians to say, 'The hell with you, George Bush, 
we're going to handle this ourselves,' "" said Jim Overman, 68, of Elk Grove. 
Overman said he has been burning up the phone lines trying to persuade anyone 
who will listen that scheduled blackouts will make everyone's lives easier. 
Briggs said he has been told by constituents, including irrigators and food 
processors, that scheduled blackouts are the way to go. 
Irrigators would know that they shouldn't plan on getting water on a day that 
their electronic gates might be closed. 
Businesses could tell workers to stay home on a blackout day, or arrange for 
backup power generators, he said. 
""We would be very interested in it,"" said Ed Yates, senior vice president of 
the California League of Food Processors. 
Power blackouts are chaotic for processing plants, Yates said, requiring some 
plants to be re-sterilized and shutting down operations for more than a day. 
Some processors might choose to close on days when they faced a blackout, he 
said, losing revenue but avoiding the loss of thousands of pounds of food. 
""It doesn't solve the problem, but it helps manage a very difficult 
situation,"" he said. 
Briggs said that his plan would result in possible blackout days every two 
weeks. The plan would assume that a certain number of customers would have to 
turned off to keep the grid operating. If the electricity shortage went above 
that amount, people might still face unanticipated blackouts, Briggs said. 
One question is public safety. Some are queasy about burglars knowing when 
blackouts will occur. But pluses include the ability to arrange for temporary 
stop signs at road intersections, or families being able to arrange for a 
sick relative to be moved. 
""If the police have only five minutes notice, they can't get to difficult 
intersections to direct traffic, they can't help paramedics, fire departments 
and ambulances get where they have to be,"" Davis said. 
The manufacturers' association and other business groups haven't endorsed the 
idea yet, but say it's worth a look. 
""It's preferable to random, rolling blackouts,"" Rothrock said.

Californians' priorities for solving the crisis are outlined in a Field Poll
?Related graphic

Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief 
(Published May 23, 2001)

Californians have some clear ideas on how to solve the energy crisis: build 
more nuclear power plants, cap the wholesale price of electricity and relax 
air-quality standards to allow older plants to be upgraded. 
And, according to a Field Poll released Tuesday, they're not so hot on the 
recently approved $13.4 billion bond authorization to pay for electricity, or 
the idea of Gov. Gray Davis seizing power plants through eminent domain. 
Poll architects said responses may be somewhat colored by respondents' 
unfamiliarity with all the issues or skepticism on the causes of the state's 
power woes. Nearly 60 percent said it essentially is an artificial crisis 
created by power companies to make money. 
But on one longstanding issue -- nuclear power -- the poll showed a clear 
preference and a dramatic shift in public opinion. 
In the highest recorded support for nuclear power in California since before 
the Three Mile Island disaster in 1979, 59 percent say they favor more 
nuclear plants in the state to provide electricity. 
Support among registered voters grows to 61 percent, with 33 percent opposed. 
Among Democrats, 53 percent support more nuclear plants, and three-fourths of 
Republicans and 55 percent of others agree. 
""The change in attitude is very significant because they know this issue,"" 
Field Poll Director Mark DiCamillo said. 
Californians' support for nuclear power reached nearly 70 percent in the 
mid-1970s in the aftermath of a nationwide energy crisis. But it plummeted to 
37 percent in 1979 after the partial meltdown at Pennsylvania's Three Mile 
Island plant and fell to 33 percent in 1984 -- the last time Field surveyed 
the question. 
In 1989, voters demanded that the Sacramento Municipal Utility District's 
Rancho Seco nuclear plant be shut down. The utility complied and has spent 
more than $200 million decommissioning it during the past 12 years. 
Although the poll results are in line with some private surveys done recently 
by nuclear-energy advocates, opponents say the Field Poll opinions could be 
misleading because the issue has been dormant for so long. Not since the late 
'70s has an application for a nuclear plant been filed in the United States. 
Only two operate in California -- San Onofre in San Diego County and Diablo 
Canyon in San Luis Obispo. 
""When the (poll) questions are on issues that people haven't thought about 
that much lately, you do get some aberrant results,"" said Bill Magavern, a 
lobbyist for the Sierra Club. ""People right now are obviously concerned about 
electricity, but they haven't really thought about what it would be like to 
have a nuclear power plant in the neighborhood."" 
The Field Poll results lend support to at least one aspect in the national 
energy plan recently released by President Bush, who called for more nuclear 
power plants nationwide. 
But poll respondents were even more insistent that the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission should impose caps on wholesale energy prices despite 
opposition from the Bush administration. The poll showed 70 percent of all 
adults and 68 percent of registered voters -- including 57 percent of Bush's 
fellow Republicans -- support the price controls. 
""It really does expose the Bush administration to long-term serious problems 
in California if they're perceived as not willing to help the state in this 
regard,"" DiCamillo said. ""The public really thinks (price caps) should be 
imposed."" 
Republicans in the survey support price caps despite Bush opposition, and 
Democrats narrowly oppose the move by Democratic lawmakers and Davis to 
authorize the largest bond sale in national history to pay for power 
purchases. 
Among all adults, 38 percent approve of the move, and 52 percent oppose it. 
Democrats disapprove of the bonds by a 46 percent to 44 percent margin. 
Californians' desire for clean air is softening in the face of the energy 
crunch, respondents said. 
By a margin of 51 percent to 41 percent, poll respondents say they would 
maintain air-quality standards rather than relax them to build plants. That 
support is down from a Field survey in January, when 59 percent said they'd 
rather maintain standards. Moreover, a majority (53 percent) say they would 
relax air-quality standards to get older plants back in operation, an 
increase from 47 percent in January. 
Slight majorities support a state-run public power authority (54 percent) and 
state-owned power transmission lines (51 percent), but DiCamillo said that 
some poll respondents were probably not familiar with all the implications of 
those moves. 
Responses to the idea of Davis seizing power plants if prices continue to 
rise this summer fell somewhat down partisan lines, with Democrats in favor, 
50 percent to 42 percent, and Republicans opposed, 52 percent to 32 percent. 
Overall, the idea was rejected by 48 percent of adults and favored by 44 
percent. 
A strong majority of registered voters, 56 percent, oppose additional 
offshore oil and gas drilling to ease the energy crunch, and 38 percent favor 
it.

Offshore drilling waits in the wings


(Published May 23, 2001)

WASHINGTON -- The release today of a piece of President Bush's energy policy 
has California lawmakers squirming. 
A natural gas advisory panel is set to unveil a 56-page report looking at 
whether moratoriums on offshore oil and gas development should be lifted. It 
will also name specific sites for possible drilling. 
Rep. Anna Eschoo, D-Palo Alto, said Tuesday that if the Bush administration 
tries to undo moratoriums protecting more than 170 million acres off the 
California coast, it would be like ""targeting a missile at us."" 
So far, the Bush administration hasn't taken any direct action. The energy 
policy he released last week calls for more oil and gas development, but its 
only recommendation about offshore drilling was that the secretaries of 
interior and commerce re-examine current laws and executive orders ""to 
determine if changes are needed."" 
Today's report is to urge selection of five of the most promising gas 
prospects in offshore areas covered by moratoriums in a pilot program aimed 
at eventual drilling. The report doesn't say where those five pilot areas 
should be. But Reps. Lois Capps, D-Santa Barbara, and Mike Thompson, D-Napa, 
are fearful that Morro Bay in San Louis Obispo County and the Eel River Basin 
in Humboldt County in their districts are likely choices.

Bush, Davis to meet, discuss state's energy crisis 

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 23, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) After weeks of holding California and its electricity crisis at 
arm's length, President Bush will plunge into the problem next week during a 
two-day visit to the state that will include a possible energy summit with 
California Gov. Gray Davis. 
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer told reporters Wednesday that the 
state's energy crisis will be ""at the top of the list"" when the president and 
the governor meet. The president's aides said that the time and place for the 
meeting are still being worked out. 
Bush's visit to the state will be his first since last fall's campaign. With 
their party enjoying only a slim majority in the U.S. House, some California 
Republicans have expressed dismay over their state's absence from the 
president's extensive post-inaugural travel schedule, fearing that the energy 
crisis could cost some GOP lawmakers their seats in next year's elections. 

Fleischer's announcement Wednesday of the meeting with Davis and its emphasis 
on energy caught many by surprise because the White House had given no hint 
until then that the president would address the issue during his upcoming 
trip to California. 
However, Davis called the White House on Tuesday night proposing a meeting 
with the president specifically to discuss energy. 
He followed up with two letters on Wednesday expressing the need for quicker 
action on the energy front: ""Californians can't afford to wait four or five 
years for a permanent solution. We need relief today."" 
In the longer of two letters, Davis wrote: ""You and I don't agree on 
everything. But here's something we do have in common: we both inherited an 
energy mess. And the people that elected us expect us to clean it up."" 
Davis also offered in the letters to ""introduce"" Bush to ""business owners and 
everyday citizens who have been personally affected by this energy crisis."" 
Fleischer said Wednesday that Bush would meet with ""business leaders and 
energy consumers."" 
Asked who initiated the meeting with Davis, Fleischer suggested the 
president's schedule had been drawn up independently of Davis' suggestions. 
""This is a case of they both want to meet with each other, and we're very 
pleased to be able to make it work out,"" he said. 
As for the meeting with the business leaders, Fleischer said, ""The president 
has several events on his schedule that already include business leaders and 
energy consumers, and so it very well may happen that we're each suggesting 
similar things, which would be a healthy sign."" 
Bush's itinerary also includes a stop on Tuesday at the Camp Pendleton Marine 
Corps Base designed to showcase his order directing the military to cut their 
energy use by 10 percent at California facilities. 
Fleischer said that the president wanted ""to talk about how the federal 
government is going to be a strong partner to the state of California in the 
cause of energy conservation to help ease the burden in California as they go 
through the summer months when demand is high and blackouts are most at 
risk."" 
The White House released an outline of the president's California itinerary 
on Tuesday afternoon. It indicated that the visit would not give prominent 
attention to the state's energy woes. 
Fleischer declined to say whether the president would expand on his energy 
plan in any way while in California. 
Davis and other California Democrats have been sharply critical of the Bush 
administration for failing to take decisive action to help alleviate the 
electricity shortage's toll on the state and its citizens. 
They are backing legislation due to come to a key vote on Thursday before the 
House Energy and Commerce Committee that would cap electricity rates in the 
state. The administration and most of the state's Republican lawmakers oppose 
the measure. 
Last week, Bush showcased an administration task force report on the nation's 
energy challenges that stressed long-range solutions focused mainly on 
increasing the supply of fossil fuels and an expanded role for nuclear power. 
The report also suggested incentives to encourage energy conservation and 
greater fuel efficiency. 
Bush's trip will begin on Monday when he flies from a Memorial Day event in 
Arizona to Los Angeles where he will spend the night. He will return to 
Washington on Wednesday night after a visit to the Fresno area. 
Bush assumed office despite losing the nation's most populous state by a 
decisive margin and then launched into the most ambitious travel schedule of 
any modern president. It included stops in 27 states ) not California.

California Democrats seek price caps on electricity

By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE 
May 22, 2001 
WASHINGTON ) Accusing power generators of price gouging, a group of 
California House Democrats vowed Tuesday to try again this week to legislate 
price caps in order to bring down the energy bills in the state. 
Rep. Henry Waxman, a Los Angeles Democrat and author of the price-cap 
measure, said he would offer the measure as an amendment on Thursday. At that 
time the House Energy and Commerce Committee plans to complete work on a bill 
designed to reduce the number of blackouts expected in California this summer 
due to shortages in the supply of electrical power. 
Waxman and other Democrats seized on Republican fund-raising events on Monday 
and Tuesday nights involving President Bush and Vice President Cheney, 
charging the Republican administration with exacerbating the California 
situation by doing the bidding of the oil and gas industry in return for 
campaign contributions. 
""This is a contrived crisis in order to wreck our environmental protection 
laws,"" Waxman said. ""It is a contrived crisis in order to produce 1000 
percent increases in profits for some of these generators."" 
On the agenda when the committee meets Thursday will be a bill by Rep. Joe 
Barton, R-Texas, that would allow California Gov. Gray Davis to temporarily 
waive some air pollution limits to increase power production in the state 
when blackouts are imminent. 
It also would include: 
  federal help to ease a power transmission bottleneck in the Central Valley; 
  mandated power savings at federal facilities; 
  state discretion in adjusting daylight savings time; 
  an easing of the ties of some small, independent power generators to large 
utilities. 
Earlier this month, a subcommittee chaired by Barton rejected Waxman's 
price-cap amendment as some California Republicans complained that the idea 
of limiting power rates was politically inspired and would do nothing to 
solve California's crisis. 
The Bush administration and the energy industry oppose price caps, saying 
that such an approach would distort the market and worsen the electricity 
shortage in California and many other western states by discouraging 
exploration and production. 
Waxman's plan would require federal regulators in many cases to tie wholesale 
power rates to production costs, plus a ""reasonable"" profit. 
At the press conference, Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego, derided Republican 
opposition to price caps. 
Referring to wholesale power generators, Filner argued, ""They were making 
money at $30 a megawatt; now they are charging up to $2,000. Believe me: They 
can make money off the market with a cost-base rate. They have done it for 
100 years. They can continue doing it."" 
Rep. Jane Harman, D-Redondo Beach, said that California Republicans on the 
energy committee would suffer politically if they give into pressure from 
party leaders to oppose the price-cap bill. 
""There are no party affiliations for rate payers,"" said Harman, a committee 
member. ""Republicans and Democrats have both seen the gouging of their rates 
in California."" 





Mexico: No limit on number of new plants to be built 



Energy chief says 'anyone who requests a permit will get it'
By Diane Lindquist 
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER 
May 22, 2001 
Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens said yesterday that Mexico won't set 
any limit on the number of power plants in Baja California supplying 
electricity north of the border. 
""Since there's a window of opportunity here because of the need in California 
for electricity, anyone who requests a permit will get it,"" Martens said 
after speaking at the Institute of the Americas' 10th annual Latin American 
Energy Conference in La Jolla. 
Power plant construction in Baja California has become one of the most 
immediate solutions to California's electricity shortfalls. At least three 
plants being built in Baja California in the next four years will send 
electricity north of the border, where blackouts have interrupted normal 
activity. 
One facility, a Sempra Energy Corp. power plant near Mexicali, will export 
all of its electrical output to consumers north of the border. The San Diego 
company's project gained quick approval from Mexican authorities because the 
facility is not subject to restrictions imposed on private companies that 
supply electricity to the Mexican market. 
Other Mexican energy officials have said several other enterprises are 
interested in building similar facilities in Baja California. 
Such a mushrooming of projects is prompting concern on both sides of the 
border that the plants might have harmful effects on natural resources and 
public health and safety. 
In his speech, Martens emphasized Mexico's commitment to preserving the 
environment and local communities. 
But afterward, he said Mexico will approve any number of Baja California 
projects to serve California consumers. 
""I don't see any limit. The only limit is the ability of the interconnecting 
lines to transmit the electricity that is produced,"" he said. 
With a capacity of only 400 megawatts each, the two transmission 
interconnections linking the electricity grids of California and Baja 
California will not be able to transmit all of the 1,500 megawatts of 
electricity for the California market produced by the new Baja California 
plants -- let alone any additional facilities. 
Sempra, whose San Diego Gas & Electric subsidiary owns both the 
interconnecting lines, plans to upgrade the interconnector near Mexicali, 
spokesman Michael Clark said yesterday. The improvement will transmit 
electricity from Sempra's plant in Baja California to the company substation 
in Imperial Valley. The other connection links San Diego and Tijuana. 
Clark said he doesn't know how the other companies building Baja California 
plants plan to transmit their electricity. Representatives of the firms could 
not be reached yesterday. 
Even if the companies find a way to send electricity across the border, the 
California grid system presents another obstacle. 
To prepare for the possibility of more demands on the Southern California 
grid, the Imperial Irrigation District is analyzing what capacity it has for 
transmitting supplies on its lines and how to assess tariffs for the service. 
""It's become very important because of our proximity to Mexico,"" said 
district spokesman Ron Hull. 
The ability to transmit electricity is only one force limiting plant 
construction in Baja California. Another is the supply of fuel to drive the 
facilities. 
Sempra again is a key player in this area. It plans to build a North Baja 
Pipeline that will supply natural gas to its own and two other power plants 
in Baja California and the proposed Otay Mesa plant in San Diego. The 
pipeline won't provide fuel for any other facilities. 
""It's fully subscribed,"" said Clark. ""In the future if there is enough 
demand, the compression could be increased."" 
Energy Secretary Martens, however, hinted at the possibility of new natural 
gas supplies in Baja California. He said Mexico wants liquified natural gas 
facilities to be built in Rosarito Beach and Ensenada. 
While several companies have expressed an interest in such an operation, 
Martens' comments were the first to indicate that two, and not one, might be 
approved for Baja California. 




Potential governor candidate launches Northern California tour

(05-24) 00:01 PDT LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- 
Republican William E. Simon Jr. says he won't decide until the first week of 
June whether to jump into the race for governor, although he appeared to be 
campaigning for the job this week. 
Trailed by a group of reporters Wednesday, the wealthy Pacific Palisades 
investment banker visited Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and took a 
few jabs at both Democratic Gov. Gray Davis and his potential GOP primary 
opponent, Secretary of State Bill Jones. 
""I think there's a leadership crisis in Sacramento,"" said Simon, who 
criticized Davis' handling of the state's power crisis. 
""You have the same elected people today trying to figure out a solution to 
the crisis that got us into the crisis,"" Simon said. 
Pressed to explain how he would end the crisis that has brought rolling 
blackouts and soaring power bills, Simon said he still is preparing his own 
plan. 
The son of Ford administration Treasury Secretary William E. Simon insisted 
he has yet to make a final decision on whether to run in 2002, adding he 
would make up his mind by June 4 after consulting with his family. 
Asked if he has any ties to companies profiting from the power crisis, Simon 
said he owns a ""small piece"" of a Texas-based company that makes equipment 
used in extracting or processing oil and natural gas. 
Before founding his investment banking firm with his father in 1988 he was an 
assistant U.S. attorney in New York. 
Simon started forming a campaign team in March, including John Herrington, 
former U.S. energy secretary under President Reagan and former chairman of 
the state Republican Party. 
Of potential primary opponent Jones, Simon said: ""He seems like a perfectly 
nice fellow. ... I just don't think that he provides the contrast to Gray 
Davis that I do.""

POLL: Californians dissatisfied with government handling of energy crisis

(05-24) 06:22 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- 
Over the past four months, Californians have developed increasingly negative 
feelings toward state and federal officials and agencies involved in 
California's energy crisis, according to a Field Poll released Thursday. 
A large number of those surveyed are also fearful that Pacific Gas & 
Electric's bankruptcy filing will make it more difficult for the company to 
provide service to its customers. 
Fifty-seven percent of those questioned in May by the Field Institute, a San 
Francisco-based nonpartisan polling organization, gave California's private 
electric utilities a poor rating. That's more than the 40 percent of 
respondents who rated the utilities performance as poor in January. 
The same negative feelings held true for out-of-state energy providers. 
Fifty-five percent of respondents this month rated their performance as poor, 
a noticeable increase from the 44 percent of respondents who gave them a poor 
rating in January. 
Specifically, those surveyed were asked to rate the job being done by 
officials and groups working to improve the energy situation in the state. 
The poll found that: 
* The percentage of those surveyed who gave the state Public Utilities 
Commission a poor rating rose from 42 percent in January to 52 percent in 
May. 
* 41 percent of those surveyed gave the state legislature a poor rating in 
May, as opposed 36 percent in January. 
* 38 percent gave Gov. Gray Davis a poor rating in May for his handling of 
the state's energy woes, a sharp increase from 22 percent who gave him a poor 
rating in January. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission also drew negative ratings from 
respondents. In May, 52 percent said FERC was doing a poor job, as opposed to 
40 percent who gave the commission a rating of poor in January. 
Those surveyed were also asked if PG&E's bankruptcy would make it more 
difficult for the company to supply electricity to customers, and 49 percent 
said they thought it would. 
The poll, which questioned 1,015 California adults between May 11 and May 20, 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points, the institute 
said.

Energy crisis to cast long shadow 
A look at what energy crisis means to future

NS121240.DTL&type=news 
What we need to do is tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to how you use energy. Turn off those things that use electricity. 
And drop out of the power grid by using alternative power sources and 
alternatives to power sources. 
That's the only thing we can do in the short term. 
In the long term, you can almost see what will be coming down the pike. 
As the state's energy problems worsen, as the state throws its surplus down a 
rathole, as our own utility bills skyrocket and as blackouts roll across the 
state, someone will write a statewide ballot initiative and get it on the 
ballot. 
It will do two things. 
First, it will undo the deregulation of the state's energy industry. It will 
try to put everything back the way it was. 
Second, it will punish the producers of power and energy. 
It will levy some new fee or tax or it will regulate the industry as a public 
utility or it will require that the state take over the industry entirely. 
Huge amounts of money will be spent against it. Opponents will outspend 
supporters by a substantial amount. 
TV ads will run constantly, predicting dire consequences if the initiative is 
approved. 
We'll be told it will be bad for business. Labor leaders will tell us that it 
will cost jobs. Experts will say it will have no effect on the problem, or 
make the problem worse. 
All of that will probably be true. 
The initiative will pass easily. 
It will pass because it will appear to address what are widely understood as 
the two main causes of the current energy crisis -- a badly bungled 
deregulation and unbelievably greedy energy producers. 
It will pass because the initiative's authors will understand that most of us 
are furious about the way this mess was created and that we're eager to take 
it out on the industry leaders we see as the leading villains. 
It will pass precisely because all the people who will tell us it shouldn't 
are the people who got us into this disaster in the first place, and we won't 
believe them. 
It's much harder to say whether the energy crisis will have more immediate 
political repercussions for some of the elected officials we might blame for 
the problem -- such as the state Legislature and Gov. Davis, who could have 
done something about this a year ago and chose not to. 
Yes, the latest polls make it clear that Californians are furious with Davis 
and the Legislature. 
But elections for office are not yes/no propositions -- you don't get to vote 
up or down on Davis. 
They are a contest between two major party candidates, which means elections 
are always a matter of comparisons -- Davis compared with his opponent. 
Someone has to come along and convince voters he or she can do the job better 
than Davis. 
There might, indeed, be such people. It's unlikely one of those people will 
appear on the ballot in 2002, however. 
The current political landscape is heavily populated with profiles in 
discouragement -- people who, fearful of losing, lack the nerve to run 
against a well-financed incumbent. 
The great irony here is that voters thought term limits would solve that 
problem -- rather than being stuck with a well-financed incumbent, we'd force 
him out of office. 
In reality, we're stuck with the well-financed incumbent until his term 
limits are up -- in six or eight years. 
That does nothing to solve the problems that might arise in those six to 
eight years. It has done nothing to embolden would-be candidates. Now, they 
just meekly wait their turn. 
And it has made a shambles of the legislative process by populating the 
Capitol with people who don't know what they're doing, only where they're 
going next. Meanwhile, the people who do know what they're doing have been 
kicked out office. 
It's no coincidence that the deregulation mess was made in a Legislature full 
of people elected during the term-limit era. 
A statewide initiative, brave candidates, ending term limits -- those are all 
things that will happen in the future. 
Right now, it's time to tune in, turn off and drop out. 
Tune in to what you are doing as an individual consumer -- cast a critical 
eye at your own habits. 
Turn off your appliances, your lights, your air conditioner and reduce your 
individual energy consumption. It's much easier than it appears. 
Energy consumption has dropped in my household by more than a third by 
switching off some lights, converting to fluorescent light bulbs, turning 
down the refrigerator and connecting some appliances to a power strip, so 
that they truly are turned off. 
Finally, drop out of the power grid. Look for other ways to power your home 
-- most notably solar power, which is readily available. 
Find other alternatives to high-consumption appliances, such as clotheslines. 
Drop out. 
They can't gouge you if they can't get to you.

Power tips 
Chronicle readers' suggestions for coping with California's energy crisis

I live in Sacramento, where we do use air-conditioning in the summer. I 
covered two skylights with aluminum foil to keep the heat out. Two east- 
facing windows have exterior roll-up blinds. . . . I adjusted my pool pump 
from six hours per day to two hours from 6 to 8 a.m. This saves electricity 
and puts the usage in the morning, which is not the peak usage. I keep my 
computer power strip and music/VCR power strip switched off. This alone saves 
about one kilowatt hour per day. I replaced four of my most used lights with 
fluorescent bulbs. You really don't need to change all of your bulbs, just 
the ones that are on for several hours per day. So far, I've cut about 
one-third of my usage, with very little lifestyle change. 
Martin R. Fraser

Household air conditioners are energy guzzlers. Consider, instead, the merits 
of an evaporative cooler (a.k.a. swamp cooler), ideal in low-humidity locales 
such as California. They consume only about 25 percent of what it would take 
to operate an air conditioner. 
Martha Kimmich 
Walnut Creek 
The suggestion that a frost-free refrigerator's compressor will run less if 
ice cubes are put in Tupperware because it won't waste energy trying to 
""defrost"" trays of ice cubes is pure nonsense. The duration of the defrost 
cycle is controlled by a timer, which turns on a heater for a fixed duration 
of time daily. Putting ice in Tupperware will, in fact, prevent the cubes 
from ""evaporating"" (technically - sublimating) as they do when left in their 
trays for long periods, and as such is a good idea - but not because the 
compressor will run less. 
Jack Petit 
The five major league baseball teams in California need to move to a day- 
only schedule for the rest of the year. That will also mean no Monday night 
games for the NFL teams this fall or winter. . . . No more private and public 
tennis clubs leaving their lights on their courts late into the night. . . . 
Attempt to combine or limit the venues in which public meetings are held. 
Often these halls are overly well-lighted, with only a few citizens 
attending. Reduce hours amusement parks are opened, and reduce the amount of 
lighting in underused areas. Limit the hours movie theaters are open. The 
matinees are sparsely attended, but use a lot of power to light and cool the 
theater. 
Hugh Cavanaugh 
When is San Francisco going to catch up with the rest of America and begin to 
install high-density sodium vapor lamps (the ""yellow light"") in place of all 
of its outside public lighting? They use one-third the energy of ""white 
light"" and put out three times the light. Also, if the state would give 
building owners a tax incentive to install ""motion sensor""-controlled 
lighting systems, all these empty office buildings' lights could safely be 
shut off at night when these large buildings are empty. 
Rollin W. Roberts 
Require that all businesses keep their doors shut when open for business. One 
day recently on upper Market Street when it was 55 degrees and windy, I took 
a tally and 60 percent of the businesses had their doors open. 
Bill Choisser 
San Francisco 
After your dishwasher has completed the wash cycle, open the door, pull out 
the racks and there will be a big whoosh of steam. The hot temperature of the 
dishes and glasses themselves (from the wash cycle) creates instant 
evaporation. In a minute your dishes are dry and cool. The only reason for a 
drying cycle is because they're enclosed. 
Dan Lucas 
(One reader) wrote she turns off all her large appliances, including TV/VCR, 
at the breaker box, when not in use. These appliances do not use power when 
the switches are off, except maybe a clock. Most circuit breakers are not 
rated for switching purposes. They are for over-current protection only. Over 
time you will damage them with continual on/off switching.

Sacramento -- Gov. Gray Davis will issue an executive order today requiring 
that Californians be given at least one hour's notice before blackouts hit, 
according to a top administration official. 
The one-hour notice is double what the California Independent System 
Operator, managers of the state's electrical grid, proposed earlier this 
week. The ISO board is scheduled to discuss its plan at a meeting today. 
Details of Davis' plan were still being worked out, said the administration 
official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. But any plan would have to 
order the ISO to give more notice of potential blackouts. 
Davis also hopes to give 48-hour and then 24-hour notices of probable 
blackout scenarios. Administration officials said the two-day notice would go 
to law enforcement, while everyone would get a 24-hour warning. 
Business groups welcomed the executive order. 
""We need to plan, we need to make adjustments in business schedules,"" said 
Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations for the California 
Chamber of Commerce. ""There are concerns about employee safety issues. The 
more notice we have, the better we can accommodate the blackout."" 
Carl Guardino, an ISO board member and president of the Silicon Valley 
Manufacturing Group, has been pushing for an advanced notification plan and 
working with the governor. 
""Sixty minutes is twice as good"" as 30 minutes, he said. 
With little doubt that blackouts will hit this summer, lawmakers have been 
searching for a way to make them easier on residents and businesses. 
""As much notice as possible would be helpful. It's helpful to have some 
advance notice for planning purposes, but small businesses will still be hurt 
by the blackouts,"" said Shirley Knight, assistant state director of the 
National Federation of Independent Business. 
""Most small businesses are in the service sector so they're open during the 
day, which means small-business owners aren't going to be able to recoup 
those blackout costs like a manufacturer might be able to,"" Knight said. 
But one consumer group said Davis should be doing more to stop the blackouts 
from happening in the first place. 
""It's like saying you're going to know a half hour earlier that an earthquake 
is coming,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer 
Rights. ""We should be stopping blackouts by standing up to the energy 
generators, rather than giving us an extra 30 minutes."" 
'POWER WATCH' 
The Independent System Operator's proposed plan for forecasting potential 
blackouts envisions a system that would provide a 24-hour notice of high- 
demand days. A ""Power Watch"" would be declared whenever a Stage 1 or Stage 2 
alert is likely, while a ""Power Warning"" would be issued whenever there is at 
least a 50 percent chance of a Stage 3 alert, when electricity reserves drop 
below 1.5 percent. 
Until now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning of 
blackouts, saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a 
chance that a last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. said it would welcome the advance notice to be 
able to notify customers who rely on electricity for life-critical equipment 
and large businesses. 
""We welcome advance notice from the ISO that would allow us to communicate to 
customers about pending rotating outages,"" said Ron Low, a spokesman for 
PG&E.
The public safety aspect must be taken into account, said one consumer group. 
""Blackouts have serious consequences, not just economic,"" said Mindy Spatt, 
spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco. ""They create 
public safety hazards, and all of those issues cannot be addressed from 
warnings. But knowing in advance is better."" 
E-MAIL ALERTS
The ISO also has been working to upgrade its Web site to provide the most 
current information about how much electricity is being used and how much is 
available. It will also establish a system this summer through which that 
information can be sent in an hourly e-mail. 
This information may make it easier for larger users of electricity to plan 
their operations. 
Enlightening advice to prepare for blackouts Here's some advice from PG&E and 
local utilities about how to prepare for blackouts: 
-- Have a flashlight and radio with fresh batteries available. If you light 
candles, observe the usual safety precautions. 
-- If the lights go out, check with neighbors to determine if your home alone 
is affected. It may be a downed power line or some other problem, in which 
case you should alert PG&E or your city electrical bureau. 
-- Unplug or turn off all appliances, TVs and computers. Leave one light on 
to warn you when the power comes back on. 
-- When the power returns, turn one appliance on at a time to prevent power 
surges. 
-- Don't plug a generator into the wall; when the lights return, it can send 
a high-voltage current through the system that can electrocute power workers. 
-- Don't open your refrigerator, so your food will remain cold. 
-- Tell children who are home alone to remain calm, turn off the TV and 
computers and not to use candles.

Californians angry across the board in energy crisis 
Poll rates Bush worse than Davis

Californians are increasingly unhappy with the way Gov. Gray Davis has 
handled the state's power crunch, but he has plenty of company in their 
energy doghouse, a Field Poll shows. 
The state's power companies, out-of-state energy providers, President Bush 
and the Legislature all come out worse than Davis in the survey. 
""Davis' ratings have gone down, but a lot of others are given lower ratings"" 
when people are asked to rank how the politicians and institutions are 
handling the state's energy situation, said Mark DiCamillo, director of the 
Field Poll. 
Growing worries about the seriousness of the power problem have sent ratings 
skidding for anyone connected with the energy business. 
""Everyone has gotten tarred,"" DiCamillo said. 
A solid 57 percent of those surveyed believe that Pacific Gas and Electric 
Co. and the state's other private electric utilities have done a poor or very 
poor job with the energy problem, with out-of-state power providers ranked 
almost as low. But 54 percent also put Bush's efforts in the poor/very poor 
category, and 52 percent consigned the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
to the same level. 
The growing disdain for the federal energy program probably can be linked 
with the president's refusal to back limits on energy prices, which are 
supported by a wide range of California residents, DiCamillo said. 
""To the extent that federal officials are seen as not bending on that issue, 
"" he said, ""I suspect that their ratings will continue to be rather dismal."" 
The survey showed that Davis has had some success in his attempt to deflect 
the blame for California's energy woes from his office, but there are 
indications that that strategy may not work forever. 
Although 41 percent thought the governor was doing a good or very good job 
with the power crisis in January, that number fell to 27 percent in the new 
survey. The percentage of residents giving him poor or very poor marks jumped 
to 38 percent, up from 22 percent in January. 
The survey was conducted May 11 to May 20 of 1,015 California residents. It 
has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. 
In the survey, Californians were quick to congratulate themselves on their 
own response to the energy problem. The poll showed that 39 percent believe 
residential energy consumers are doing a good or very good job responding to 
the problem, up from 26 percent in January. 
""People think they're making an effort to conserve,"" DiCamillo said. ""In the 
public's eye, it's everyone else that is not doing what they should be 
doing."" 
The survey also shows that the public has few illusions about the seriousness 
of the energy crunch. More than 80 percent believe it will be a year or more 
before the energy crisis is resolved, and more than half are convinced it 
will take at least two years to ensure a steady supply of electricity. 
""The gravity of the situation is such that the public is bracing itself for a 
long haul,"" DiCamillo said. ""The state hasn't been able to fix the problem in 
a hurry, and people don't believe it's going to happen."" 
The survey also showed that nearly half the state's residents believe that 
PG&E's bankruptcy will make it harder to continue to supply electricity to 
its customers while 59 percent say it would be a serious problem if 
businesses began to leave the state because of the possibility of blackouts. 
Concern about the continuing energy problem was strong across the state, 
DiCamillo said. 
""This is recognized as a major statewide issue,"" he said. ""People think it 
will have an effect on them, regardless of where they live.""

OAKLAND 
Council lowers hurdles to renewable energy

To encourage Oaklanders to take advantage of renewable energy, the city will 
waive fees and expedite plans for residents and business owners who want to 
install solar panels or other alternative energy generators. 
Previously, getting the necessary permits could take as long as eight weeks 
and cost more than $1,000. 
But under a measure proposed by Mayor Jerry Brown and approved Tuesday night 
by the Oakland City Council, the design review process will be waived if the 
equipment installation meets certain requirements, such as matching the pitch 
of a sloped roof. Permits will be free.

THE ENERGY CRUNCH 
New tips on power squeezing

U190766.DTL&type=news 
If you want to wrap yourself in the flag these days, there's no better way 
than by promoting energy conservation. 
Scientists from the Lawrence Livermore and Lawrence Berkeley national 
laboratories held a news conference yesterday to highlight new technologies 
and information sources to help consumers and businesses cut down on 
electricity use this summer. 
Flanked by tiny models of buildings with white roofs (up to 45 degrees cooler 
than dark ones), big charts showing U.S. energy flow and an array of ""energy 
vampire"" devices such as battery chargers that suck power whenever they're 
plugged in, earnest researchers discussed ways Californians can reduce their 
electricity use by 20 percent this summer. 
Meeting the goal has a big payoff, besides the obvious one of averting 
blackouts: Under the governor's 20/20 Rebate Plan, those who conserve 20 
percent this summer compared with the same months last year will not only 
shave that amount off their bills, but also get an equivalent rebate from the 
state -- essentially saving 40 percent. 
The technologies were a combination of new twists on humble objects and 
futuristic geeks-only inventions: 
-- WEB SITES. For folks who want to get a taste of the high-wire act lived 
every day by California grid operators, energycrisis.lbl.gov gives real-time 
data on the current supply and demand for electricity in the state. When you 
see the purple line (forecast load) start to hover near the red line 
(potential capacity), you know it's time to turn off the lights and hit the 
Save button. 
Lawrence Berkeley Lab is sponsoring three Web pages -- savepower.lbl.gov, 
HomeEnergySaver.lbl.gov and HomeImprovementTool.lbl.gov -- that offer 
customized conservation tips based on the user's climate and type of house -- 
saving 8 percent by using clotheslines instead of a dryer, for example. 
-- LAMPS. Lawrence Berkeley scientists have created the eponymous ""Berkeley 
lamp,"" expected to go on sale in July for under $150. It's a high-performance 
table lamp with two fluorescent bulbs that together use less than 110 watts, 
but provide light equivalent to 300 or 400 watts. The lamp provides both 
""uplight,"" for illuminating an entire room, and ""downlight,"" for close tasks 
such as reading. To be manufactured by Light Corp. of Minnesota, it will be 
sold through the company's Web site at www.lightcorp.com. 
Another, existing lamp -- a floor-standing torchere that uses compact 
fluorescent bulbs instead of halogen bulbs -- is widely available in hardware 
and lighting stores from a variety of manufacturers. 
-- WINDOWS. ""Low-emissivity"" windows look as transparent as regular glass but 
reflect infrared light, reducing heat transmission. The technology is now 
available in about 40 percent of windows sold. Consumers can recognize 
energy- efficient windows by a government ""Energy Star"" label; more 
information is available at www.efficientwindows.org. 
-- SCI-FI CHANNEL. At Lawrence Livermore Lab, scientists have been working on 
technology that's not for average users, but could eventually bring us up to 
date with the Jetsons. 
Technologies include electromechanical (flywheel) batteries, which can bridge 
the gap when the power goes off, thereby protecting sensitive electronic 
equipment. 
Then there are solid oxide fuel cells, which produce energy from fuel without 
using combustion -- a technology of the future, both for vehicles and 
stationary power. 
The Livermore researchers are also studying ways to make geothermal energy 
(which accounts for 6 percent of California's supply) more efficient and 
methods to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel generators. 
Further out, scientists hope to be able to store electricity, so energy from 
wind farms, for example, could be used at the times it's needed the most, 
instead of only when the weather cooperates.

House panel calls off vote on Calif power bill
WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy and Commerce Committee has called 
off, at least temporarily, a vote on legislation to aid California and other 
states during this summer's expected electricity shortage. 
Rep. Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican chairman of the committee, said 
lawmakers needed more time to seek a bipartisan deal to get agreement on 
immediate help for power-starved California and the West. 
``We may be on the verge of a very solid bipartisan agreement,'' Tauzin said. 
He hoped that talks on Thursday would allow a vote on the pending legislation 
as early as today. 
The legislation was written by Republicans to reduce demand and encourage 
more supply of power in California this summer. Many Democrats on the 
committee objected to the bill, saying it needed a provision to cap wholesale 
prices in the entire Western region or else it fails to help the situation. 
Republican lawmakers, along with the Bush administration, strongly oppose 
price controls.






Davis proposal for more diesel power draws environmental criticism
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- California would get a little power and a lot of 
pollution from a proposal being considered by Gov. Gray Davis that would pay 
owners of backup generators to produce electricity. 
The proposal, one of several options the governor is considering, would pay 
for diesel power -- which at its dirtiest is 500 times more polluting than 
the cleanest natural gas power plants -- when electricity supplies are 
stretched. 
``If backup generators were to be used, it would only be as a last resort to 
avoid blackouts,'' said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar. ``Unfortunately, we 
are in an emergency situation. Everything is on the table.'' 
California's persistent power shortage has led to rolling blackouts around 
the state several times this year, with more anticipated when hot summer 
weather prompts people to use air conditioning. 
If all of the state's backup generators ran full time, they would produce 
about 425 tons of nitrogen dioxide per day. That's more than nine times the 
pollution power plants produced on an average day in 1999, according to state 
Air Resources Board data. 
And the state would get only about 550 megawatts of electricity -- barely 1 
percent of the state's peak power needs -- from the backup generators. That 
would be enough to power about 550,000 homes. 
``They could have a huge negative effect on air quality,'' said Ellen Garvey, 
executive officer for the Bay Area Air Quality Management Agency. ``It's one 
thing to run these generators during blackouts and emergency conditions, but 
using them for other purposes could be devastating.'' 
Business groups that support the proposal include the League of Food 
Processors, the California Manufacturers and Technology Association and San 
Diego Gas & Electric. 
``These generators could go a long way to taking some demand off the electric 
grid and putting some supply back into the power system,'' said Gino DiCaro, 
spokesman for the manufacturers and technology association. 
Most of the state's 17,200 backup generators are small units that run on 
diesel fuel and lack pollution controls. Some are rentals, and others can be 
found at hospitals, office buildings, sewage treatment plants and university 
labs. 
Unlike backup generators intended for home use, which are not regulated, 
industrial-sized units are limited in the number of hours they can operate. 
But since the state's power crunch began, regional air-quality regulators 
have issued emergency rules allowing them to run more frequently. 
Diesel engines produce carcinogenic soot and oxides of nitrogen -- a building 
block of asthma-inducing smog.











Small generators fight for payment from utilities 
Posted at 11:24 p.m. PDT Wednesday, May 23, 2001 
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS 

Mercury News 


BAKERSFIELD -- A gray cat picks its way through the lot of Oildale Energy, a 
small natural gas-fired power plant on the city's gritty northeast edge. The 
clamor of machinery and trucks -- sounds that meant prosperity here -- is 
gone. Employees have painted Oildale's machinery, insulated the boilers and 
tweaked the motionless 13-ton turbine. 
Now they wait. 
``It's kind of like a skeleton,'' says plant manager Mike Pankratz, surveying 
the octopus-tangle of pipes and tanks. 
Choked by the $10 million Pacific Gas & Electric Co. owes it, Oildale shut 
down Feb.?6, taking its 40 megawatts of badly needed electricity with it. The 
hush here is the sound of small generators locked in one of the most serious 
issues of California's energy crisis -- one that state regulators plan to 
wrestle with today. 
Oildale is part of a growing legion of small generators, from geothermal to 
gas-fired co-generation plants, battling California's utilities and state 
price controls they say are crippling them. These small generators, owed 
about $1.5 billion, supply up to a third of California's electricity. 
At least 25 have sued Southern California Edison over unpaid bills. Four have 
sued PG&E. And PG&E's bankruptcy proceedings in San Francisco are clogged 
with motions from at least 19 small generators, including Oildale. In many 
cases, these companies want to end their long-term supply contracts with the 
utilities so they can sell their electricity on the more lucrative open 
market. 
``What this is, basically, is the revolt of the mice,'' said Bill Short with 
Ridgewood Power Management, a New Jersey firm that has shuttered three 
gas-fired generators in California and sued PG&E. 
Officials to weigh debt 
The companies are hoping for action from the California Public Utilities 
Commission, which is scheduled today to weigh whether to order the utilities 
to pay the back debt. Meanwhile, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali wades 
through motions filed by disgruntled generators and counter motions from 
PG&E. 
The deteriorating finances of some of the approximately 690 small generators 
threatens California's fragile power supply just as the state heads into the 
summer months up to 3,700 megawatts short. 
The deep and often unexpected economic impacts of California's energy crunch 
add up daily. In Oildale's case, the shutdown not only jeopardizes the jobs 
of its 10 anxious employees, but those of more than 150 employees at the 
refinery next door. 
It's one of the biggest public policy botches in the energy crisis, some 
energy experts argue. California is shooting itself in the foot by not 
attending to the relatively clean and efficient small power suppliers in its 
own back yard, they say. Gas-fired co-generation plants, which provide power 
to nearby businesses and sell electricity to utilities, are some of the most 
efficient producers in the state. And many of the small generators harness 
renewable resources like the sun and garbage fumes, lessening the state's 
dependence on high-priced natural gas. 
``The idea that we're refusing to step in and help them while we're paying 
through the nose to pay Dynegy and Williams and everybody else, this is just 
nuts,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 
Energy Institute, mentioning companies that own major power plants in the 
state. ``This is really a major blunder.'' 
The immediate crisis started in late January, Oildale's Pankratz explained. 
That's when PG&E told the plant it was not going to pay for electricity 
delivered in December. The news worried Oildale's gas supplier, Pankratz 
said, which halted the plant's supply. 
Pankratz turned off the plant's turbine. 
The move socked Golden Bear Oil Specialties, the refinery that looms over 
Oildale. Unable to operate without the cheap steam heat Oildale supplies, 
Golden Bear cannot heat the asphalt and industrial oils it produces. Golden 
Bear filed for bankruptcy April 23. Last week it announced plans to lay off 
172 employees. 
Golden Bear Chairman Carl Soderlind said Oildale, Golden Bear's exclusive 
source of steam heat for nearly 20 years, was a key reason his group bought 
the refinery four years ago. Having it go under was ``gut-wrenching,'' he 
said. 
Power unavailable 
The California Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's electricity 
grid, reports that 1,400 megawatts of power from small generators are off 
line. It estimates that about half of that -- 700 megawatts, or energy for as 
many as 700,000 homes -- is due to the financial squeeze of natural gas 
prices, money owed by the utilities or both. Others say financial problems 
have 1,100 megawatts off line. 
Lawmakers haven't been much help. The state Assembly on March?22 rejected a 
hastily crafted rescue bill meant to help buttress these companies. The issue 
has languished in Sacramento. 
Days later, the utilities commission ordered California's utilities to pay 
the generators for electricity delivered in the future -- which saved many of 
them -- but it did not order the utilities to pay the hefty back-due amounts. 
It also set a new rate for what utilities should pay the generators for 
electricity. That price is 22 percent lower and too low for business, some 
argue. 
The commission's position has been that the small generators should abide by 
their existing contracts, said commission attorney Gary Cohen: ``To the 
extent that some of them are facing financial hardship, the commission may 
take a look at whether it can do anything to help them vis-a-vis the back 
debt.'' 
The lack of stronger action to support these generators baffles some critics. 
``It's like talking to a starving man on a desert island and saying, `How 
long can you hold up until the ship comes?'?'' said V. John White, director 
of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. 
Some of the companies have appealed to the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission, but regulators are waiting to see if the state and the courts can 
resolve the issue. 
``We're in what essentially amounts to an abusive relationship,'' said Short 
with Ridgewood, the independent generator that has sued PG&E. 
Two courts have allowed generators fighting Edison to suspend their 
contracts. Five have lost their fights. Another five have won the right to 
put a lien on Edison's assets. 
In PG&E's battle, three of the four lawsuits are on hold because of the 
bankruptcy. In the fourth, a judge allowed a generator out of the contract it 
had terminated before the bankruptcy. 
As for Oildale, it wants PG&E to pay the $10.5 million it owes or Oildale 
wants to sell its electricity on the open market. It also wants PG&E to pay 
what it calls ``a fair market value'' for its electricity. 
If Oildale can't sell on the open market soon, it will be forced into 
bankruptcy, its attorneys argue. Pankratz estimates his plant can hang in 
limbo only three more months. 
PG&E is fighting to keep its small generators, which it says are exaggerating 
their damage. It reports that only a tiny fraction of its 300 generators are 
off line. 
Increased costs 
If the plants were released from their contracts, PG&E could not afford to 
pay the extra $284 million per month it estimates electricity would cost. The 
state Department of Water Resources -- and ultimately ratepayers -- would 
have to foot that bill. 
A fast solution isn't likely from the bankruptcy court. The judge has made it 
clear the generators raise a host of complicated legal questions. 
Meanwhile, the clock ticks. 
``We've all been a little tense,'' says Judy Andreatta, who has worked 
Oildale's front desk for 10 years and worries about her job. ``It's just so 
scary watching everything happen. Who'd ever think we'd lose power?''













Electricity notebook 
FERC may renew price caps 
May 24, 2001 
From Register wire services 
Federal regulators this week announced that they might reimpose caps on the 
cost of transporting natural gas into southern California. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Tuesday gave the public 20 days 
to comment on the possibility of reinstating caps, which were temporarily 
suspended by the commission this year. The price controls were lifted in an 
effort to expand the reach of deregulation. 
This proposed action, said Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., ""could make a 
real difference."" 
""Since FERC engaged in this experimental lifting of the cap, the price of 
natural gas in Southern California has climbed to three times higher than the 
rest of the nation,'' said Feinstein. Currently, she said, the price in 
Southern California is $12.59 per million British Thermal Units and only 
$3.70 in the rest of the Western region. Gas fuels most 
electricity-generating plants in the state. 
The commission also asked for comment on whether the caps should be limited 
to California or include other Western markets. 













Legislators search for a Plan B for Edison 
Davis' tack is politically volatile. The aim still is to steer clear of 
bankruptcy.

By HANH KIM QUACH 
and KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
SACRAMENTO Lawmakers this week will seek to swap the deal Gov. Gray Davis 
made to rescue the state's No. 2 utility from financial ruin with something 
more politically palatable. 
Davis' deal, some have complained, is sweeter for Southern California Edison 
than for taxpayers. So at least four proposals are being floated to supplant 
that plan. But legislators are far from a consensus on any of them. Plans 
emerge, recede and are reconfigured daily. 
Energy experts and bankruptcy lawyers warn that too much legislative fiddling 
could result in what neither side wants: bankruptcy for Edison. 
Bankruptcy means the state would be stuck buying energy until both Edison and 
Pacific Gas & Electric - which is already in bankruptcy - complete the 
Chapter 11 process, which could take years, experts and lawmakers said. 
The state's wallet would shrink, affecting its ability to build schools and 
roads. Ratepayers might be on the hook for an additional $1 billion for the 
company's legal fees, because bankruptcy would freeze its assets, said Brian 
Bennett, vice president of Edison International, the utility's parent 
company. 
Southern California Edison has said it's willing to be flexible on the 
governor's plan, which calls for the state to buy Edison's transmission grid 
for $2.76 billion. Company officials wouldn't comment on the various 
alternatives. 
""We understand that the transmission deal is the subject of controversy and 
are open to variations on it,'' Bennett said. 
Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, said the governor also remained committed 
to his deal. 
""Edison is going to survive,'' said Mitch Wilk, a member of the state Public 
Utilities Commission from 1986 through 1991 and a past president of the 
agency. But the question is ""whether it will survive via the (plan) that the 
governor negotiated or they do the same kind of thing PG&E did."" 
""There is still a very real risk that SCE will be forced into bankruptcy if 
the Legislature tinkers too much with the deal, or fails to move ahead 
promptly,'' Wilk said. 
PG&E chose to file Chapter 11 last month because it was dissatisfied with the 
progress of negotiations with Davis on a state rescue of the company. PG&E's 
move was an embarrassment for Davis, who had vowed to keep the state's big 
utilities solvent. 
""One of the principal chips Edison has with the state is not filing for 
bankruptcy,'' said Ed Feo, a lawyer involved with the PG&E case. ""It would be 
a black eye for the state. As long as the company stays out of bankruptcy, 
they have something to trade."" 
Edison's creditors are still waiting to see how the utility fares with the 
Legislature. Some have agreed to defer receiving payments until the end of 
June. 
Dean Vanech, president of New Jersey-based Carson Cogeneration, said a lot of 
things need to happen before he and other creditors feel ready to drag Edison 
into bankruptcy. 
""In general, we would have to feel like there was absolutely no hope in a 
deal being made,'' Vanech said. But, he admitted, ""there's a concern that a 
resolution will not be put on the table in any reasonable period of 
time.''Meanwhile, Edison has vigorously lobbied the Legislature to approve 
the transmission deal. The company has launched a public-relations campaign 
to persuade the public that it is in its interest, said John Bryson, chief 
executive of Edison International. 
""Bankruptcy is a last resort,'' Bryson said in a recent interview. ""We 
believe there will be a solution.'' 
But changes are necessary, said Senate Leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, 
""because people didn't like Plan A.'' 
Lawmakers cringed at some elements of the plan, which many thought was overly 
generous to Edison: limiting investigation of the utility's parent's company 
and guaranteeing the company an 11.6 percent annual return on investment. 
Alternatives include: requiring power generators to accept up to one-third 
less than the collective $3.5 billion they're owed; taxing Edison on its 
property and using the tax to pay off its debts; and allowing Edison to build 
more power plants. The latest proposal would require the state to sell bonds 
to pay off Edison's debts and give the state the option to buy the 
transmission lines later. Most of the proposals would require an extra 
surcharge on ratepayers bills to pay off debts. 
One hurdle the legislature faces: rallying two-thirds of each house behind 
one plan, necessary any time the state spends money. Republicans have been 
philosophically opposed to acquiring transmission lines, and half the 
alternatives include that element. 
But Stanford University professor James Sweeney thinks compromise is 
possible. Lawmakers and the utility will strike a deal simply because a 
second bankruptcy would tarnish the image of the state's political leaders. 
Sweeney believes, however, the outcome might be more fair in court. 
""Bankruptcies are messy ... but so is the political process,'' Sweeney said. 
""We're in a situation where the leadership (politically) seems not willing to 
bite the bullet. It may be better for our state to have a bankruptcy judge 
who is very strong and who isn't planning for a higher office.'' 














Long Beach obtains lien on Edison's assets 
The city is the fourth small supplier with an attachment on the utility. 
May 24, 2001 
By KATE BERRY
The Orange County Register 
The city of Long Beach became the fourth small power supplier to get a lien 
against the assets of Southern California Edison, a move that could push the 
utility closer to bankruptcy. 
Last week, Edison was ordered to freeze at least $9 million in bank accounts 
to cover payments owed to Long Beach for power Edison bought from the city's 
trash-to-energy plant. 
Getting a lien on the utility's assets ensures the city will be paid, even if 
the utility files for bankruptcy. 
Stephen Pickett, Edison International's general counsel, said the utility 
plans to appeal. 
Long Beach also is suing Edison International, the utility's parent company, 
for breach of contract, claiming the utility should not have transferred $4.7 
billion to its parent company over a four-year period beginning in 1996, when 
deregulation was implemented. 
""Edison International was required to honor the debts of its subsidiary,'' 
said Robert Shannon, Long Beach's city attorney. 
So far, Edison has been sued by 27 small power suppliers, known as qualifying 
facilities, or QFs. The lawsuits either seek to put a lien on the utility's 
assets to recover unpaid debts or attempt to terminate 20-year contracts to 
provide power to Edison. 
Edison owes QFs about $1 billion and is trying to combine the cases before a 
single judge in Los Angeles. 
But Long Beach differs from other power suppliers because it wants to stay in 
its contract with Edison. 
""We just want to be paid under our contract. We still want to deliver them 
power,'' said Shannon. 
As a municipality, Long Beach also did not have to post a bond to obtain a 
lien as the other QFs must. 
Ed Feo, a lawyer for wind, solar and biomass QFs, said liens on Edison's 
assets could have a domino effect. 
""Two things will accelerate a bankruptcy filing by Edison: Either the deal to 
sell its transmission lines (to the state) is going nowhere and alternatives 
are not acceptable - or if attachments are made to the company's property 
that the utility doesn't want to run the risk of losing.'' 
Three other QFs have posted bonds to obtain liens against Edison. They 
include Caithness Energy, which got a lien on Edison's 56 percent interest in 
two qualifying facilities that make up the Mohave Generating Station in 
Laughlin, Nev.; IMC Chemicals, a unit of IMC Global Inc. of Northbrook, Ill., 
and that won a $7 million lien; and Herber Geothermal Co. and Second Imperial 
Geothermal Co., which is owned by Covanta Energy Corp., a former unit of 
Ogden Corp., based in Fairfield, N.J. 













Poll: 59% in state favor nuclear power 
It's a reversal of views since the Three Mile Island accident. 
May 24, 2001 

The Associated Press 
Fifty-nine percent of Californians now support building more nuclear plants, 
according to a poll released Wednesday. 
The last time the Field Institute polled Californians about nuclear energy 
was 1984 - five years after the accident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania 
- and it found 61 percent opposed to nuclear power. 
""In my interpretation, the current energy crisis has some bearing on the 
public's changed attitudes on nuclear power,"" said Mark DiCamillo, spokesman 
for the nonpartisan polling organization. 
""The public is searching for clean ways to add to the capacity."" 
The Field poll comes as the Bush administration pushes for a renewed look at 
nuclear power. No utilities have ordered any new nuclear power plants in the 
United States since 1978. 
The poll of 1,015 California adults was taken May 11-20. The margin of error 
was plus or minus 3.2 percent. 
Carl Zichella, the Sierra Club's regional staff director, said Californians 
have not thought about nuclear energy for about 20 years and do not have as 
much information as they did around Three Mile Island. 
""I think this number really reflects a lack of knowledge on the part of the 
public about the problems that drove nuclear power underground,"" he said. 
""The more people know about nuclear power, the less they're going to like 
it."" 
Getting a new nuclear plant built faces two major problems: financing and 
siting, said Rich Ferguson, research director for the Sacramento- based 
Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technology. 
""We have just not seen any interest in the financial community to invest the 
billions of dollars,"" he said. 






Filing for Hayward Project Includes Request for Expedited Review


PLEASANTON, Calif., May 23 /PRNewswire/ -- San Jose-based, Calpine
Corporation (NYSE: CPN) and San Francisco-based, Bechtel Enterprises Holdings,
Inc. today filed an Application For Certification (AFC) with the California
Energy Commission (CEC) for its proposed Russell City Energy Center in
Hayward, Calif.  The filing marks the beginning of an extensive CEC licensing
process required to build and operate an electricity generating facility in
California.  The filing included a request for expedited review that would
reduce the licensing review process period from 12 months to 6 months.


The proposed Russell City Energy Center would be a 600-megawatt, natural
gas-fired, combined-cycle electric generating facility located on
approximately 14 acres of land, zoned heavy industrial, at 3636 Enterprise
Avenue in Hayward.  The site is adjacent to the city of Hayward's wastewater
treatment plant, which would supply recycled water to the Energy Center. The
Russell City Energy Center would provide needed electricity for Hayward,
western Alameda County and the San Francisco Peninsula.


The modern technology used at the facility would allow for a greater than
90 percent reduction of certain emissions and is 40 percent more
fuel-efficient compared to older gas-fueled facilities in the Bay Area.


""The Russell City Energy Center will provide a vital new source of clean,
reliable electricity in the region,"" said Curt Hildebrand, vice president and
general manager of the Calpine/Bechtel Joint Development.  ""We look forward to
working with the City of Hayward, Alameda County and the California Energy
Commission to develop a model Energy Center.""


Submittal of the AFC represents the culmination of more than six months of
extensive engineering, technical and environmental studies.


""We are hopeful that the considerable groundwork that we have laid thus
far will make this project eligible for the six month CEC review process,""
Hildebrand added.  ""We are seeking the expedited review to do everything we
can to help solve the state's energy crisis as quickly as possible.""


Once the CEC determines that the application is complete, and determine
whether the project qualifies for the expedited review process, the official
review will begin.  As lead agency, the CEC will work with environmental and
government agencies in conducting its review and will hold local workshops and
hearings to encourage community participation. The expedited review process
would require the same environmental and technical standards as the longer
review period.  Based upon the successful licensing of the project,
construction could begin in summer of 2002, with commercial operation by
summer of 2004.


Copies of the AFC filings will be available through the CEC and at local
libraries. Summaries of the study will be posted on the Russell City Energy
Center website (www.russellcityenergycenter.com).  To receive additional
information on the CEC process, visit their website at www.energy.ca.gov.  For
more information on the Russell City Energy Center, call 510-704-8475.

California Governor Signs Bill to Speed Up Approval for Power Plants



LOS ANGELES, May 22, 2001 (Xinhua via COMTEX) -- Governor of California Gray
Davis on Tuesday signed a bill to speed up the process of approving 
construction
of new power plants as a way to fight the ongoing power shortage.

""California is in a war with energy producers, and the best long-term weapon 
is
to build more power plants,"" Davis said at a signing ceremony in Elk Grove,
California.


The bill will shorten the application process for a new or remodeled power
plant, as well as the time that local governments have to review proposals.


Davis said the new bill will speed up two energy projects that are in the
process right now, including a 900-megawatt plant in Palm Springs and a gas
storage project in Lodi that will store up to 12 billion cubic feet of natural
gas.


California has been suffering from a power crisis since last year, which has
caused repeated blackouts and sent the power rate spiraling.


The crisis is largely blamed on the 1996 deregulation law that forces the
utilities to buy electricity from the wholesale market at higher rates than 
they
charge the customers. And the repairs of generators in some power plants and 
the
warming weather have made things worse.


After the heavily indebted utilities could no longer afford to buying power
anymore, the state government has used more than 7 billion dollars of tax 
money
so far this year to buy electricity on behalf of them.


Among other measures to ease the power shortage, the state government has 
called
for residents to conserve electricity as much as they can, especially during 
the
peak-hours during the day.Residents have been told to brace for a worse
situation during the incoming summer.








From the Oakland Tribune 5/24
 
Lockyer: Probe may spark suit 
Criminal charges could follow evidence of price gouging 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- State Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday his 
investigation of alleged multibillion-dollar price gouging by power 
generators has laid the foundation for a successful civil case that could win 
huge refunds. 
""But the whole house hasn't been built,"" Lockyer said in an interview with 
ANG Newspapers. 
The attorney general said the probe he expects to complete in the next eight 
weeks also may yet yield criminal charges, which could result in power 
company officials being locked up ""with my tattooed dude."" 
Lockyer, a former East Bay legislator, rattled electricity suppliers earlier 
this week when he told the Wall Street Journal: ""I would love to personally 
escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could 
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.'"" 
Houston-based Enron, like other energy-trading firms, has denied wrongdoing 
in the California market. It dismissed Lockyer's comment as not warranting a 
response butquietlyprotested to the Davis administration. Other power 
companies have expressed outrage. 
""I was trying to convey a message to ... the out-of-state energy generators,"" 
Lockyer said. ""I decided to make the point with the energy generators that 
they've got a serious fight on their hands."" 
The attorney general, however, conceded he has ""felt guilty about it ever 
since because I'm a prosecutor and I take pride in being careful about these 
sorts of accusations or claims."" 
""But I know it won't be in print unless I find some sort of colorful way to 
... pump up the rhetoric,"" he said. 
""We don't care if they're multi-millionaires. We don't care if they run big 
corporations. They're buccaneers. They're ripping us off. 
""Now, while we're still in the legal analysis of whether it's legal or 
illegal greed, it's clearly immoral. There's no debate about that."" 
Lockyer said his investigators are scrutinizing tens of thousands of 
transactions and hundreds of thousands of documents to determine the strength 
of the state's case. 
""I think there is strong evidence that lays the foundation for a successful 
civil action, but the whole house hasn't been built,"" Lockyer said. 
A civil case could result in refunds that ""disgorge the obscene profits,"" he 
said. 
The California Independent System Operator, which manages the state's 
electric transmission grid, estimates that power suppliers may have 
overcharged California by $6.8 billion since early last year. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has so far tentatively ordered 
California suppliers to make only tens of millions of dollars in refunds as 
part of that agency's ongoing probe. 
Lockyer said criminal charges will be filed if investigators find that 
company officials intentionally engaged in unfair business practices. 
The attorney general said he hopes to complete the work within the next eight 
weeks despite what he called stalling tactics such as those by three energy 
firms -- Reliant and Dynegy of Houston and Mirant of Atlanta. 
The three companies agreed Tuesday to surrender copies of internal documents 
that had been subpoenaed two months ago by Lockyer as part of the probe. 
""They've been throwing $500-an-hour lawyers at us in high volume to drag 
their feet and stall our investigation,"" Lockyer said. 
The attorney general's comments come amid a flurry of lawsuits and 
allegations by California officials against power suppliers, as well as 
ongoing probes. 
Besides the attorney and FERC, the Legislature, state Public Utilities 
Commission, Cal-ISO and the California Electricity Oversight Board are all 
conducting investigations.

		 Subject: Additional Soil Investigations, North Coles Levee

After reveiwing the documents entitled, ""Baseline Environmental Investigation 
of Arco North Coles Levee Plant 8, Rogas Loading Facility and Associated 
Natural Gas Pipeline Systems Kern County, California"" and ""Report of 
Preliminary Asessment Sampling North Coles Levee Gas Plant Loading Rack Area 
Tupman, California"", it appears that the following areas should be 
investigated further to detemine horizontal and vertical extent of  
identified contamination from the above referenced reports:

 Tank 15 area-  total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Glycol reboiler area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

 Hot oil heater area- total petroleum hydrocarbons

   Wash rack area- lead

 Propane comp. area lead  
    total petroleum hydrocarbons
    chromates

 Cooling tower area- chromates

 Compressor area- BTEX
    chromates
    lead

In the ""Baseline Environmental Investigation"" report, sampling was only 
conducted to an approximate depth of 2.5'.  I am not comfortable with basing 
decisions for further investigations on such a shallow depth, in leau of the 
fact that  many times water soluble constituents may horizonatlly move 
vertically from surface shallow depths into the lower subsurface areas.  This 
is indeed the case for chromates.  I based my recommendations for metal 
concentrations on the federal RCRA Subtitle C hazardous waste target levels 
for metals and evaluated  the TPH and BTEX levels with the  underground 
storage tank guidlines for California.  There were references to a 1989 
document in the ""Baseline"" report for specific parameters, but there may have 
been an update to target contamination level requirements since that date and 
therefore, I used 10,000 ppm which is a general action level for most states 
for total petroleum hydrocarbons.  Again, I did not evaluate the mercury or 
the loading rack issues.

One last issue.  As you know, identification of contamination is usually 
accomplished by sight observations of visible contamination, knowledge of 
processes and or history.  Report results of the surface contamination do not 
show there to be an immediate environmental concern.  Due to the age of the 
facility, there may be concerns which were not identified in the reports.  
However, based upon the locations of the preliminary samplings which were 
conducted throughout the facility, it appears that the information presented 
in the reports would be adequate to address suspected contamination at the 
facility.

Constellation to Build Major Plant in California, 
First in Over a Decade

by Will McNamara 
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

Constellation Energy Group (NYSE: CEG) announced that Kiewit Industrial 
Company of Omaha, Neb., will begin construction in early April of the 750-MW 
High Desert power plant near Victorville, Calif. The project, which has been 
in development since the mid-1990s by High Desert Power Project, LLC*a 
subsidiary of Constellation Energy Group of Baltimore, Md.*will be the first 
new major power plant to serve the Southern California area in more than a 
decade. 

Analysis: The fact that California suffers from a significant supply / demand 
imbalance, and that no new major power plant has been built in the state in 
over a decade, has been well documented in the energy industry press. 
Consequently, the fact that Constellation Energy Group is now close to 
breaking ground on its new plant (having completed the laborious plant siting 
requirements in California) is a major*and somewhat surprising*coup for the 
company, considering that its generation expertise has primarily been in the 
Northeast nuclear industry. Constellation Energy Group has said that it will 
market power from the plant within California, which should prove to be a win 
/ win scenario for both the company and the state. 

The High Desert power plant will be built on a 25-acre site at the Southern 
California Logistics Airport, formerly known as the George Air Force Base. 
Commercial operation of the plant is scheduled for June 2003. The plant's 
electric generating technology is based on clean-burning, natural gas-fired 
combustion turbines operating in a combined-cycle mode. Part of the current 
supply problem in California is the fact that hydroelectric resources, the 
state's primary energy source, have been in short supply due to 
lower-than-average rainfall over the last year. Moving away from a dependency 
on hydroelectric supply may be a smart move for the state. In addition, the 
High Desert plant is consistent with a national trend that supports natural 
gas as the fuel of choice for new power plant development projects. As a 
point of interest, according to data from the Energy Information 
Administration, California's fuel mix is primarily based in a mixture of 
natural gas (45.59 percent), hydro (21.95 percent), nuclear (18.07 percent), 
coal (1.36 percent), oil (1.04 percent), and other, presumably renewable, 
sources (11.98 percent). 

It is rather surprising that Constellation would be the first company to 
build a major power plant in California in over a decade, considering the 
company's consistent geographic and fuel-mix focus. Constellation Energy 
Group is a holding company that includes a group of competitive energy 
businesses focused mostly on wholesale power marketing, merchant generation 
and portfolio management in North America. Constellation Energy Group is the 
parent company of the Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), a regulated 
gas and electric delivery company serving Central Maryland. Up until this 
point, Constellation's generation assets have been primarily based in a 
mixture of coal and nuclear, and for the most part located in the 
Northeastern United States. According to information directly from the 
company itself, Constellation's own fuel mix is predominantly coal (54 
percent), followed by nuclear (40 percent). Oil, gas and hydro only represent 
a small percentage (6 percent) of Constellation's fuel mix. 

Although coal is the primary fuel in Constellation's portfolio, over the last 
year the company has become more focused on nuclear. For instance, last 
December Constellation Nuclear, a wholly owned subsidiary of Constellation 
Energy Group, announced its intent to purchase 100 percent of Unit 1 and 82 
percent of Unit 2 of the Nine Mile Point nuclear power plant. Once the deal 
is closed in mid-2001, Constellation will own a total of 1,550 MW of Nine 
Mile Point's 1,757 MW of total generating capacity. The nuclear plant 
purchases that Constellation is making expand upon its Calvert Cliffs asset, 
an 850-MW two-unit nuclear plant in Southern Maryland. When I wrote about 
this acquisition last December, I noted that, while Constellation will most 
likely retain its coal-fired generation assets, the company appeared to be 
moving closer toward a nuclear-based portfolio. 

In addition, in early 2000 Constellation began a restructuring of its 
corporate identity, dividing its operations into two separate segments: one 
focused on its merchant energy business (including Constellation Nuclear) and 
the other focused on regional retail energy services. The merchant energy 
business was ranked fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the 
third quarter of 2000, and the company is committed to expanding this growth. 
The goal for the merchant energy business, according to Constellation Energy 
Group CEO Christian Poindexter, is to establish a portfolio of over 30,000 MW 
of electric generation facilities by 2005. Toward that end, Constellation 
acknowledged earlier that it would be taking advantage of ""bargain prices for 
nuclear plants,"" which resulted in large part from other utilities focusing 
on transmission operations and thus choosing, or being mandated, to divest 
their generation plants.  Constellation in the past has justified its move in 
this direction by saying that its experience has found that nuclear fuel is 
cheaper than coal and gas generators and that ""the economics [of nuclear] are 
quite robust, once they are calculated out.""  

However, considering that there is only a limited number of nuclear plants in 
the United States that will become available for purchase, Constellation 
Energy Group may have recognized the need to become even more diversified. 
The California market, despite its stringent plant siting requirements, 
arguably offered an appropriate market for Constellation to become more 
diversified. Given the state's environmental lobbying presence, it is 
doubtful that a nuclear plant could have been approved in California. 
Although natural gas is not a primary fuel source for Constellation as a 
company, it is the preferred source for new power plants. Therefore, the High 
Desert plant, given that it will be fired by natural gas, presumably stood a 
greater chance of navigating through California's plant siting requirements 
(than a coal or nuclear plant could have). In fact, in the announcement of 
the plant, Constellation noted that, having received all federal, state and 
local approvals, the High Desert plant ""will be a good neighbor in the 
community with no significant environmental impacts."" 

The announcement of Constellation's new plant could not come at a better time 
for California, of course. Although the plant won't be operational until June 
2003, the state can use the good publicity now. A new report from the 
Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA) says that it is already too late 
for the state to head off a serious summer shortage that could lead to at 
least 20 hours of rolling blackouts. ""It's too late for this summer,"" 
declared Lawrence J. Makovich, of CERA, referring to the state's desperate 
efforts to ramp up power supplies for the short term. ""The source of 
California's far-reaching power crisis is a shortage. At least 5,000 
megawatts of new generating facilities are required to restore balance to the 
state's grid."" Instead, according to the report, demand will exceed supply by 
3,000 MW, which will cause the state to be under an energy alert of some sort 
for at least 200 hours. 

CERA's report came out on the heels of Calif. Gov. Gray Davis' pledge to have 
5,000 MW of new generating capacity available in California by July, more 
than double the amount expected just a few months ago. Davis said the new 
plants would provide enough electricity to ward off blackouts this summer, 
which CERA obviously disputes. Davis announced a series of orders intended to 
bring online 5,000 MW by July 2001, with an additional 5,000 MW by July 
2002.  

In any event, as California continues to struggle from a severe supply / 
demand imbalance, the announcement of Constellation's new plant appears to be 
good news for all the parties involved. Gov. Davis has pledged to support an 
expedited approval process for additional plants, so it will be interesting 
to see which company is given approval to proceed with the next power plant 
in the state. It will also be interesting to see, based on Constellation's 
plant and others that may be built, whether or not the economics of building 
such plants in California will prove beneficial. Other power suppliers may 
opt to merely enter into long-term sales agreements with the state, rather 
than invest the resources that building a power plant would require.

Subject: Re: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad 
faith?  

Luiz,

Generally an excellent job.  

I would make a stronger point of the fact that many technical experts (us 
included) believe that cost-of-defecit should be multi-tiered, and that even 
the first tier should be higher.  I also wouldn't concede that changing the 
cost of defecit is a change of the rules.  Nevertheless, leaving it where it 
is probably the best compromise between true market incentives and political 
pressures.

I would also strengthen the arguments supporting the MAE: e.g. there is no 
substitute for an efficient central clearing mechanism with accurate price 
signals, credit integrity, and timely cash settlement.  I WOULD NOT make the 
resolution of Angra II a pre-condition for the continuing well-being of the 
MAE.   Let's just get the market working now (e.g. governance, 
penalties/guaranties, accounting) on an ongoing basis; I think that the issue 
of Angra II can be treated separately.

Given the current discussion vis-a-vis the constitutionality of ammending the 
Consumer Protection Code by executive fiat, I agree with your decision to 
avoid the discussion of pass-throughs.

I think it's a great idea, Luiz.  How about a paper organized around Remi's 
four points with you developing the arguments (such as the argument for 
contract sanctity included in this e-mail chain).  Perhaps Orlando and / or 
Kish could get a meeting with Parente to present the paper and explain how it

I think it is a good idea to state our position on Annex V and to take this 
chance to reaffirm our belief in the following 4 basic principles:

1. Contract sanctity (Annex V holds, all contracts hold)
2. No caps on spot prices (if Brazil still wants to attract private funds in 
new generation)
3. Pass through of MAE price at LDC level for end-user consumption above 
their respective quota
4. Brazil needs MAE to settle: make it work.  Only way: reinforce credit 
worthiness of all MAE members.

Subject: ASMAE taking the [wrong] view on Annex X - Ignorance or bad faith?


Last Friday, Patricia Arce, (Mario Arce's daughter and a full time  ASMAE 
employee) was expressing her [distorted] views  to the press on why 
generating companies should not abide by Annex V. She was not speaking on 
behalf of ASMAE: however, she was probably reflecting ASMAE view. 

I did not mean to shoot the messenger, but I could not refrain myself from 
expressing an opposite opinion.

There are two problems in Patricia's view:

1) She is not supposed to express any views on contracts. MAE should only 
settle contracts, but never attempt to arbitrate or solve bilateral contract 
disputes. The lack of clarity on this point is the sole responsible for MAE's 
frustrated attempt to solve the Angra II - Furnas conflict in the last 6 
months.  Informativo Regulat?rio # 4 explores the issue in more detail.

2) She was dead wrong. Quite na<ve arguments. 



A few arguments why Gs should indeed abide by Annex V (we may use externally, 
as you see fit)

1) Gs were forced to sign Initial Contracts.
 * So what? It is a regulated contract by nature, as so many others, such as 
CUST, CUSD, CCT, CCD. Does it mean that parties signing those other 
agreements should not abide by their clauses?

2) Gs and Ds did not have chance to negotiate terms and conditions
 * So what? I asked Patricia why should any agent sign the Market Agreement 
without any chance to negotiate its terms (it is by definition an adhesion 
contract). Does it mean that agents should not abide by the MAE Agreement 
provisions? Guess what the answer was? None

3) Some Gs did not sign Annex V - e.g. Furnas, which [apparently] disobeyed 
Annel's instructions (as per Law 9.648/98)
 *  This is serious
 *  That means that in addition to not be bound by Contract, those Gs do not 
want to abide by Law? No response

4) Some companies do not have Annex V
 * So what? Discussion is about Annex V
 * Those companies should follow specific provisions on their supply contracts

6) Ttariff (energy price) was not subject to negotiation as part of the 
Initial Contracts - therefore, they were not able to price the risk 
represented by Annex V
 *  So what?
 *  Many contracts have regulated prices. All use of system contracts have 
regulated prices.
 *  Furthermore, the privatized generators had chance to price the Annex V 
risk. Why giving them a windfall now? (Since it is a zero sum game, a 
windfall for generators is tantamount to a loss to distributors)

7) Annex V was not designed to deal with rationing: it was designed to 
mitigate hydrological risks due to central dispatch
 * Wrong
 *  ERM (Mecanismo de Realoca??o de Energia) was the mechanism put in place 
to deal with risks deriving from a central dispatch in a hyper tight pool 
operation
 *  Annex V was indeed designed to deal with rationing. It is called ""dry 
period relief"" clause. It was proposed by the generators and approved by 
Annel. The spot price is a ""proxy"" for the depth of rationing. One should not 
evoke rationing.


I think it is advisable to have a strong legal opinion on how Annex V is 
""bullet proof"". In the meantime, let me share my views:

 * There is very limited room for negotiation whatsoever on Annex V and on 
the [ridiculous] proposal made by generators that merchant plants should 
collect part in cash and part of their sales in [junk] bonds. We should make 
this clear at the outset. 

 *  We should make Minister Patente realize  that Mario Arce's proposal is 
non-sense. Changing established contracts or setting caps on spot prices  is 
a bad precedent. No bail out for the ones who did mitigate perfectly known 
risks. A cap on spot is equivalent to what the Central Bank did for Makra and 
Fonte-Cindam (and became a public scandal) .  If we do want to create a 
market , we need to have responsible contracting. Irresponsible contracting 
should not be forgiven. If we do it, we will create a bad precedent and a 
poor environment for contracting. We have to show Minister Parente that 
irresponsible contracting has to be penalized at market rates (no caps on 
spot). Irreponsible contracting will not expand capacity. Breaching contracts 
will create an uncertain environment for new PPAs. Crisis will get worse and 
worse.

 *  Generators should have the burden of proof.  In the meantime, Annex V is 
effective and should be enforceable

 * Regarding California case, as mentioned by Mario Arce: It is a totally 
different situation. In California D/Cs were not allowed to contract. In 
Brazil they were strongly encouraged. Generators who signed Annex V could 
also have hedged their residual risks on Annex V.They did not. They acted 
irresponsibly. They second-guessed regulations. They did not help in 
expanding capacity. They knew goverment will bail them out and revoke Annex 
V. 

 *  The argument ""no one should lose, no one should gain"" during rationing is 
inconsistent with market signals. Some one has to lose, some one has to gain 
by definition. And [hopefully] someone has to go bankrupt. This will be a 
great lesson. People will start taking market signals more seriously. 
Otherwise, there will never be expansion and there will never be a market.

 *  We have to be as transparent as possible.

Finally, I suggest Enron to write a position paper on our own view on Annex V 
and caps on spot and deliver it to Minister Parente early this week. 

I volunteer to prepare a first draft, if you guys agree it is a good idea.

		 Subject: RE: SBX 9 (Elimination of Standby Charges)



I  agree. We should see the forest and not all the trees.
?
Bottom-line SBX 9 is a big step forward? in deploying clean  distributed 
generation. 
?
There  are always specific elements/details, which?might have been done  
differently, but I do believe most of us agree that this is a very positive 
step  for California and it will significantly help the State in the very 
challenging  energy situation it is facing.

It  would make since for people to read all of the language and to think in 
a  constructive manor.? If anyone is concerned with what can or can not be  
done they should feel free to call me.? Thus far every serious member of  the 
real estate community that I have spoken with or heard from is very  pleased 
with this progress.

Steven:
Not a single building owner I have talked to  beleives that you can install a 
meanigful amount of DG by July 1st.?  The bill is meaningless to BOMA with 
that amendment.? What plans are we  making to take that limitation out of the 
bill or to push it back?? If  not, the I don't think BOMA will support the 
bill any more.

Subject: SBX 9 (Elimination of  Standby Charges)

The Distributed  Energy Resources industry won a major battle yesterday.? 
The  California Senate Energy and Utilities Committee passed on a 7-0  
bipartisan vote, Sen. Morrow's (and while her name wasn't on this  bill,?it 
was as much Sen. Alpert's) bill on eliminating any tariff  that discriminates 
against DER.? SBX 9 was derived from the omnibus  DER bill SBX 35 which is 
still alive and contains many important  provisions fro removing additional 
barriers.? Yesterday's vote  represents a major win because even if the bill 
ultimately does not get  enacted, a very important statement has been made by 
the committee.?  I'm sure the CPUC will take notice in their  proceedings.
?
The DER community  owes much thanks to Sen.'s Morrow and Alpert, and the 
Utilities Committee  Members and their staffs:
Sen. Bowen  (Chair)
Sen.  Alarcon
Sen.  Battin
Sen.  Dunn
Sen.  Murray
Sen.  Poochigian
Sen.  Sher
Sen.  Speier
Sen.  Vasconcellos
Sen.  Vincent
?
Also much thanks to  everyone who worked incredibly hard and diligently on 
this effort.?  From the business, consumer advocacy, environmental, 
government,  manufacturing, and real estate communities.
?
Here are the  highlights of yesterday's actions:
?

For IOU's- No  discriminatory tariffs for new DER installed between May 1, 
2000 and  June 1, 2003 if DER is in combined heat and power mode.? If you  
have a peaking unit with gen only, then you have until??July 1  2001, to get 
it installed.? 
DER installed within  the window gets the exemption until June 1, 2011.  
The maximum capacity  of the DER is 5 MW in aggregate per site.  
The DER must have  emissions levels of 9 PPM or better until the ARB 
established new  guidelines and standards, expected late this year or early 
next  year.  
Customers with DER  are still required to pay interconnection, public purpose 
charges, and  obligations incurred under the Dept. of Water Resources energy 
purchases  program.  
The CPUC shall  require the electrical corporations to include non-utility 
owned DER in  its planning process.  
The CPUC is required to  establish a firewall so that in the event that the 
implementation of DER  results in net costs to the system, those costs stay 
within the customer  class.  
The CPUC shall  require the utilities to establish new rates for DER that 
are  non-discriminatory and take into account the benefits as well as the  
costs.  
Muni's are required  to review their tariffs for barriers to entry and hold 
public meetings  to solicit comment for recommended changes.

Now we have momentum,  but there is still a tremendous amount of work to do 
on the Assembly side  and with Governor's office.? We need the continued 
(increased)  support of all of you as we move this forward.

HOMEPAGE: http://www.thelaw.net  REMOVE: http://www.thelaw.net/remove.htm

     Why, in the information age, do so many continue to pay so much to West 
and Lexis? There is an excellent answer to this question. Enhancements.

--YOU OWN THE LAW

     West and Lexis do not own the law. You do. Your tax dollars already paid 
for the raw data generated by governmental instrumentalities; data that West 
and Lexis snags and enhances. Thereafter, your organization pays and pays for 
a laundry list of enhancements intended to make this raw data more useful.

--THE VALUE OF ENHANCEMENTS

     In many cases these enhancements also lead to negative experiences such 
as tedious training seminars, repeated calls to tech support, and an 
overwhelming sense that for many bread and butter research and reference 
tasks, there has to be a better, faster, easier, less expensive answer.
     Are all of these enhancements really worth 10 - 20 times the price of a 
subscription to TheLaw.net, particularly when West and Lexis are available on 
the web 24/7 whenever you really need them as long as you have a credit card? 
How much would you otherwise pay per year for unlimited access to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, the 13 Federal Circuits, the 50 state supreme courts and the 
intermediate level appellate courts? Call you local rep and ask?

--THE NUMBER ONE ENHANCEMENT: SEARCHABLE CASE LAW

     In our opinion, the number one enhancement West and Lexis have to peddle 
are their searchable case law databases. But we have one, too; the third 
largest on earth next to theirs. With an annual subscription to TheLaw.net 
Professional Convenience Edition you can search 24 hours a day for an entire 
year, across more than 175 Federal and state appellate jurisdictions for just 
$345 if you sign up by April 30, 2001. And we don't insult your intelligence 
by slicing things up. Everybody gets everything we have on an unlimited use 
basis. Is that a model you've been waiting for, or what?
     We even place browsable and searchable Federal and state statutes, 
forms, rule, regs, courts, executive agency databases, legislative tracking 
tools, news and reference desk resources, right where you want them; a mouse 
click or two away on your desktop.

--CONSIDER OUR REFERENCES

     Why take our word for it? Consider our references and reviews, some of 
which we've published to our web site. http://www.thelaw.net/references.htm

--THE THREE RULES OF OUR SUCCESS

      At TheLaw.net Corporation we have three simple rules:

----RULE ONE: Everyone gets everything we have.
----RULE TWO: Similarly situated subscribers always pay the same price.
----RULE THREE: Current prices are always out in the open on our web site:
--------$395 annually for you
--------$575 for you and a partner
--------$1195 for your five user workgroup
--------Enterprise Licenses are also available.
See, http://www.thelaw.net/subscribe.htm

     Imagine. No surprises. No meters. No printing, downloading or 
pay-per-view fees. In short, none of the gamesmanship you have come to expect 
from the big two compusearchers.

--CONSIDER OUR VISION: A FIRM FOUNDATION AT A LOW FLAT-RATE

     TheLaw.net, privately held and successful from Day One, represents the 
next logical step; a big improvement over slogging through two billion web 
pages and otherwise watching legal research costs spiral out of control at a 
time when with normal free market principles at work, such costs would be 
plummeting.
     In some instances, subscribers have found they no longer need to deal 
with West or Lexis. In most instances they have found that the list of 
expensive resources that they need to buy is much shorter. And we always 
remind them that everything West and Lexis has is available pay-per-view, a 
la carte, via the Internet. All you need is authorization from your client 
and a credit card.

--SAVE $50 ON THELAW.NET PROFESSIONAL CONVENIENCE EDITION

     Subscribing to TheLaw.net is not a decision you need to overthink. An 
individual annual subscription to TheLaw.net Convenience Edition is on sale 
right now for just $345. It includes an unconditional 30-day money back 
guarantee and you can install at work, at home and on your laptop.
     Stick your big toe in the water and see how good it feels. We already 
know that 95% of our subscribers stay with us past the 30-day opt out period 
and that 75% will begin adding TheLaw.net to additional desktops within 90 
days.
     A lot has changed since you went to law school. One of the biggest 
changes is that the days of two legal research behemoths calling all of the 
shots and making all of the rules are over. The time is now to lose the 
chains by subscribing to TheLaw.net Professional today. At your option, we 
can build your package and deliver it today via our web site or we can ship 
CDs via U.S. Priority Mail or FedEx. We thank you for your time and we hope 
to hear from you soon.

Title: Briefing Note: Demand Overtakes Hydro in 2000
Author: Moritzburke, Zenker, Snyder
E-Mail Category: Alert
Product Line: California Energy ,
URL: http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/eprofile.cfm?u=5166&m=1054 ,

Western energy markets are starting the new year with precipitation 
conditions that suggest a repeat of 1999's hydroelectric conditions: 
near-normal snowpacks in the Pacific Northwest and Canada and low snowpacks 
in California. More significantly, even if snowpacks remain high in the 
Pacific Northwest, normal demand growth coupled with normal runoff patterns 
in the second and third quarters of 2000 would

*  reinforce the likelihood that gas prices will again set the floor for 
on-peak power prices

*  keep differentials across western power markets narrow

*  support higher power prices and increase volatility as gas-fired 
generation is run more intensively to meet demand in a market with tightening 
capacity margins

From 1999 to 2000, natural gas demand will swing upward by nearly 1,200 
million cubic feet (MMcf) per day in the third quarter in response to a 
return to normal hydroelectric output and demand growth. Gas price increases 
will follow from this increased demand. Although differentials between Topock 
and the Henry Hub during the third quarter of last year averaged only $0.05 
per MMBtu above the Henry Hub price, CERA expects to see differentials this 
year averaging around $0.25 per MMBtu above Henry. This stronger western 
demand should also narrow differentials between the Henry Hub and the San 
Juan Basin, and to a lesser extent, between Henry and the Permian Basin.

Western Snowpack and Hydro Capacity: A Subregional Story
Since the beginning of winter the Pacific Northwest has received normal 
precipitation, with greater snowpacks in the northern part of that region 
than in the southern part. California currently lags behind historical 
precipitation levels at roughly 26 percent of average (see Figure 1). Given 
current conditions, it is possible that California will end winter at 
below-average hydroelectric conditions.

Western hydroelectric facilities are concentrated in Oregon, Washington, and 
British Columbia, which contain over 75 percent (roughly 46,500 megawatts 
[MW]) of the Western Systems Coordinating Council's (WSCC's) hydroelectric 
capacity, producing 80 percent (roughly 253,500 gigawatt-hours [GWh]) of the 
region's total hydroelectric generation in an average year (see Figure 2). 
Because of this high concentration of facilities, above-average precipitation 
in the Pacific Northwest can help to offset below-average precipitation in 
California and other parts of the West, although transfer capabilities limit 
the amount of energy exported from those regions.

Power Markets for 2000: Building on 1999 Dynamics
Despite hydroelectric output that was 15 percent higher than average in 1999, 
western power prices reflected the cost of gas-fired generation resources 
during nearly all periods of the year. This was a greater proportion of the 
year than in 1998 even though hydroelectric production in 1998 was only 95 
percent of 1999 levels.* CERA expects several factors to strengthen this 
dynamic in 2000, assuming normal weather conditions:

*  Western demand growth. Normal weather and economic growth will increase 
regional demand by roughly 2 percent in 2000. Growth will be strongest in the 
second and third quarters, at 6 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, adding 
9,000 GWh of demand in the second quarter, followed by 6,000 GWh in the third.

*  Return to normal hydroelectric production levels and patterns. Not only 
was 1999 hydroelectric production above normal, but 1999 Pacific Northwest 
runoff was prolonged by cool weather in the second and third quarters. Normal 
runoff dynamics in 2000 would remove roughly 6,500 MW of hydro capacity from 
the Pacific Northwest resource stack from the second to the third quarters 
(see Figure 3). By contrast, Pacific Northwest hydroelectric capacity was 
depleted by an estimated 3,000 MW from the second to the third quarters in 
1999 as a result of slower snowpack melt. This provided unseasonably high 
hydroelectric availability in the Pacific Northwest through the third and 
fourth quarters. The combination of reduced hydroelectric availability in a 
normal-weather year in 2000, a shifting of hydroelectric production back to a 
second quarter peak, and higher West-wide demand will increase the pull on 
nonhydroelectric generation resources (see Figure 4).

*  Energy exports to California. Sustained hydroelectric availability in 1999 
in the Pacific Northwest allowed exports from the region to California to 
remain strong through the third and fourth quarters, with exports at 150 and 
290 percent of normal, respectively. Exports added roughly 1,400 average 
megawatts (aMW) above average--and as much as 2,000 aMW in August--to 
California's resource base throughout the year. For 2000, CERA expects normal 
hydroelectric exports to average roughly 2,000 aMW (total of 17,500 GWh) 
during the year and 2,400 aMW (total of 5,300 GWh) in the third quarter (see 
Figure 5).

In 2000 the combination of normal load growth, normal spring and summer 
weather, and reduced hydroelectric availability will cause capacity margins 
to shrink, particularly in California (see Figure 6). The impact on power and 
gas prices will be

*  Higher average power prices. Lower average streamflows will diminish the 
output of run-of-river hydroelectric facilities during peak summer demand 
periods. As runoff dwindles into the summer, production from reservoir-fed 
facilities is available for a decreasing period of the on-peak hours. Other 
generation resources, particularly gas-fired, will be used to meet demand 
during a growing number of shoulder and off-peak hours in 2000. On-peak power 
prices will be driven higher by the increased use of gas-fired generation 
during shoulder hours. Off-peak power prices will respond to the greater 
reliance on gas-fired generation during those hours.

*  Higher average gas prices. Gas demand for power generation is expected to 
increase by 600 MMcf per day on average in 2000 and by up to 1,200 MMcf per 
day in the third quarter. This will contribute to price strength in western 
gas markets and to the higher costs of generating power.

Natural Gas Market
Although the effects of a return to normal hydro conditions become most 
evident in the third quarter as overall generation loads increase, CERA 
expects that some decline in hydroelectric output relative to last year is 
already causing a modest increase in gas demand in California. Although 
January West Coast weather has been comparable to last year, flows into 
California are up by 300 MMcf per day so far this month; storage withdrawals 
are up on a year-over-year basis as well. Based on the lower snowpack and 
lower average precipitation in California this month relative to last 
January, in-state hydroelectric generation explains approximately 400 MMcf 
per day of increased gas demand.

Normal hydroelectric generation this year will likely bring a 250 MMcf per 
day increase in western gas demand for power generation during the first 
quarter. Early indications of normal-to-above-normal snowpack and 
precipitation in the Pacific Northwest should center these increases in 
California.

This modest demand increase has helped support prices in the western markets, 
with regional weather differences contributing to western strength as well. 
Weather in both the United States as whole and the West averaged 10 percent 
warmer than normal during December, but during January temperatures in the 
West averaged only 8 percent warmer than normal while temperatures in the 
United States averaged 30 percent below normal.

Western Regional Prices
Over the next two months as seasonal heating loads within the West begin to 
tail off and hydroelectric generation increases modestly, differentials 
between western producing basins and the Henry Hub should widen. At the same 
time, as required flows into California decline, the Topock premium above 
Henry Hub prices should decline, with prices eventually falling below the Hub 
price. However, with normal weather in the West, that general weakening in 
western prices will likely take place toward the end of February and into 
March. Given the warm January, CERA expects heating load to decline by only 
400 MMcf per during February. Loads look sufficient to sustain western 
differentials near current levels.

California
As more normal winter weather takes hold in the East, prices should increase 
in that market relative to California. So far this month, strong flows into 
the state have held Topock differentials around $0.10 per MMBtu relative to 
the Henry Hub. During February flows into the state are expected to decline 
somewhat as heating demand begins to decline. Table 1 shows expected flows 
into California for winter 1999/2000 compared with winter 1998/1999. That 
weakening in the Topock differential is limited, however. Expected lower 
storage inventories in California relative to last year, as well as a low 
upside to eastern prices, should keep Topock prices from falling more than 
$0.05 per MMBtu below the Henry Hub during February. Topock prices are 
expected to maintain a $0.03 per MMBtu premium to the Henry Hub price (see 
Table 2).

Pacific Northwest
Although some cold weather in the Pacific Northwest has held Malin prices 
close to Topock prices during January, CERA expects the Malin price to weaken 
relative to Topock during February--and more dramatically in March. Two 
factors are expected to contribute to this weakening:

*  Hydroelectric output. Although February will bring a decline in heating 
load in both the Pacific Northwest and California regions, gas will receive 
some support from decreased hydroelectric generation relative to last year in 
California. In the Pacific Northwest gas demand is limited during spring even 
in normal hydroelectric generation conditions.

*  Canadian flows. Flows to the West Coast on Pacific Gas Transmission during 
the first quarter of 1999 dropped from an average of 2.6 Bcf per day during 
1998 to 2.4 Bcf per day as Canadian supplies headed into the Midwest on the 
Northern Border expansion. This year, given the year-over-year increase in 
Canadian supply, those flows into the Pacific Northwest should rebound to 
1998 levels.

The Topock-Malin differential so far this month has averaged only $0.06 per 
MMBtu. During the first quarter of 1999, that differential averaged $0.09 per 
MMBtu. Because of the forces described above, CERA expects a wider 
differential--$0.13 per MMBtu--this February.

Rocky Mountains
Similar forces will drive a widening in Rocky Mountain prices relative to 
prices in the south. Regional Rockies supplies are likely to increase as 
regional demand declines--although warm January weather will limit declines 
to 100 MMcf per day during February. The decline in heating load in the 
Pacific Northwest, with continued strong Canadian imports, will allow 
increased exports from the Pacific Northwest into the Rocky Mountain region 
on Northwest pipeline--similar to 1998 conditions. Within the Rockies, supply 
builds continue in the Powder River Basin; the new Fort Union and Thunder 
Creek gathering systems are now delivering a total of approximately 100 MMcf 
per day into the Rocky Mountain interstate pipeline system. Rockies 
differentials to the Henry Hub should average $0.25 per MMBtu during February.

Southwest
As demand declines and supply builds in the Rocky Mountains, CERA expects the 
spread between Rocky Mountain and San Juan Basin prices to increase slightly, 
but for February, Rockies heating load will likely keep the prices close. 
Although the differential between the two basins has averaged $0.03 this 
month and held at less than $0.05 during December, a $0.05 per MMBtu spread 
appears likely for February. This slight increase marks only the beginning of 
a wider divergence. CERA expects the differential between the two basins to 
widen to over $0.15 per MMBtu this summer as San Juan prices gain support 
from strong demand in California power markets.

DISCRETIONARY LOAD CURTAILMENT PROGRAM

The California Independent System Operator (ISO) has created the 
Discretionary Load Curtailment Program (DLCP) to provide additional resources 
to the grid for the management of potential system emergency conditions.  
This program provides an energy-only payment and gives Loads total control 
over their curtailments, the control that many need to feel comfortable 
participating in a demand response program.  
The DLCP consists of two parts: 
? a Day Ahead Request, and 
? a Day Of Request for curtailment.  
The ISO will pay Load Aggregators $500/MWh for Demand they offer and curtail 
in the Day Ahead portion, and $750/MWh for Demand they offer and curtail on 
the Day Of portion.  
This program will act as an umbrella for certain UDCs, programs under 
Assembly Bill AB31x and also attracts any other aggregator that can bid load 
curtailments into the program.  A Load Aggregator (LA) can be any company who 
enters into a DLCP Agreement with the ISO.  Because AB31x provides payments 
for the bundled customers that are aggregated by the UDCs, an alternate 
agreement will be made with them regarding procedures of operation.  Non-UDC 
Load Aggregators will receive the performance payments from the ISO through 
their elected Scheduling Coordinator.  
The DLCP will operate year-round during the hours of 7:00AM until 8:00PM from 
now until December 31, 2001.  The need for this program will be evaluated 
throughout 2001 and implemented for 2002 if needed. Some provisions including 
trigger mechanisms and payments may be re-evaluated and changed based on 
Summer 2001 experience.  
The ISO is accepting proposals from those interested in being a Load 
Aggregator, starting on March XX, 2001 and continuing until the end of this 
program. For more information and a copy of the Request for Proposals, please 
visit our web site (www.caiso.com/clientserv/load) (this will be posted after 
the DLCP is approved).
The DLCP is intended to provide the ISO with Demand curtailment from Loads 
that may not be able to participate in the ISO,s Participating Load Program 
(Ancillary Services and Supplemental Energy) or the ISO,s Summer 2001 Demand 
Relief Program.  However, contracted DRP Loads may participate in the DLCP 
during months outside of the DRP period. Additionally, existing UDC 
interruptible customers that have met their yearly contractual obligation may 
participate. This new program is intended to allow end-use Loads to 
participate, through a Load Aggregator, in a curtailment program while giving 
those Loads total discretion whether to participate in any day the program is 
activated by the ISO.




Key Features of the DLCP

	Day Of:        $750/MWh 
Curtailment Window	7:00 AM ) 8:00 PM
DLCP Request	Day Ahead Request:
	Upon ISO projecting a need for demand response (the ISO may call on this 
program based upon the best available temperature, load, and resource 
forecast information) for specified hours of the next day.  The DLCP Day 
Ahead Request will be issued by 4:00PM
	Day Of Request:
	Upon ISO projecting a need for demand response (the ISO may call on this 
program based upon the best available temperature, load, and resource 
forecast information) for specific hours on that day.  The DLCP Day Of 
Request will be issued by 8:00AM.  
DLCP Offer	LAs shall respond to the DLCP Day Ahead Request by 6:00pm of the day of 
the DLCP Request. 
	
	LAs shall respond to the DLCP Day Of Request by 9:00AM.    
DLCP Confirmation 	The ISO will issue a DLCP Day Ahead Confirmation notice to 
the LAs no later than 7:00 PM of the day before the curtailment.   
	
	The ISO will issue a DLCP Day Of Confirmation notice to the LAs no later than 
9:30AM of the day of the curtailment.  
DLCP Curtailment	The LA shall assure that the Load is notified and curtails in the 
hour(s) as per the DLCP Confirmation notice.   
Use of Generation	Less than 1MW total behind each interval meter, with approval from 
AQMD.
Order / Timing of Curtailment	Because the DLCP Curtailment will be based on the times 
identified in the DLCP Confirmation notice the curtailments could occur 
irrespective of the Emergency Status.


Eligibility
DLCP Load Aggregator
In order to be eligible for the DLCP, Load Aggregators (including UDCs):
1. Must be able to provide a portfolio that contains a net reduction in 
Demand of at least 1MW, either alone or when aggregated with other customers,
2. Must sign a DLCP Agreement,
3. Must have an ISO approved performance measurement process, 
4. Must be capable of interacting with the ISO,s DLCP infrastructure as well 
as communicate with the end-use Load customer,
5. Must nominate an SC for settlement transactions with the ISO.

DLCP End-Use Load Customer
In order to be eligible for the DLCP, an end-use Load customer:
1. Must be able to provide a net reduction in Demand that meets the criteria 
of the LA, or the Local Regulatory Authority,
2. Must have an interval meter approved by the Local Regulatory Authority, or 
have the appropriate measuring device(s) as required by the approved LA,s 
performance measurement process,
3. Must be located inside the ISO Control Area (ask your LA, if you are not 
sure),
4. Must not concurrently participate in the ISO,s Summer 2001 DRP, however 
may participate during months outside of the DRP contracted period (May 
15-September 30, 2001), 
5. If the end-use load is a UDC interruptible customer, the customer may 
participate in the DLCP as long as the customer has met all the contractual 
obligations of an interruptible customer,
6. Must not have a Participating Load Agreement (PLA) with the ISO for the 
same Load offered under the DLCP,
7. Must obtain and provide positive proof of all necessary permits of 
operation or approvals from the local Air Pollution Control District or Air 
Quality Management District for each individual Generating Unit designated 
for participation in the DLCP. 

DLCP Process:
? DLCP Request
1. DLCP Day Ahead Request:
The ISO will project the need for demand response. The ISO may call on this 
program based upon the best temperature, load, and resource forecast 
information available by 4:00PM the day ahead.  The ISO will issue a DLCP Day 
Ahead Request by e-mail to all contracted Load Aggregators.  The e-mail 
notice will request the curtailment amounts for two-hour blocks within the 
ISO specified curtailment timeframe.  The ISO will provide any constraints in 
the notice.
2. DLCP Day Of Request:
The ISO will project the need for demand response.  The ISO will base this 
projection upon the best temperature, load, and resource forecast information 
available by 8:00AM of the day of the request. The ISO will issue a DLCP Day 
Of Request by e-mail to all Load Aggregators.  The e-mail notice will request 
the curtailment amounts for each two-hour block requested.  The ISO will 
provide any constraints in the notice.

? DLCP Offer
1. By 6:00PM on the Day Ahead, the Load Aggregators will submit to the ISO, 
through the ISO DLCP website, their committed amounts of Load Curtailment.  
The ISO expects that the Load Aggregators will have contacted the End-Use 
Loads in their program to determine how much curtailment will be available 
and for which hours of the day. 
2. By 9:00AM of the Day Of, the Load Aggregators will submit their committed 
amounts of curtailment.  

? DLCP Confirmation
Once the ISO reviews submitted DLCP Offers, ISO Operations will issue an 
e-mail notice to both the Load Aggregators and their Scheduling Coordinators 
accepting specific DLCP Offers.  The ISO will issue the DLCP Confirmation 
notice by 7:00PM on the day the Day Ahead Request was made and by 9:30AM for 
the Day Of Requests. These confirmation notices will request that the Load 
Aggregators communicate to the End-Use Loads the required curtailment amount 
and duration.  This will be the only communication (dispatch) to the Load 
Aggregators detailing the curtailment.  
? DLCP Performance
The effectiveness of the DLCP will be based on the performance of each 
End-Use Load in curtailing their confirmed curtailment amount. The ISO 
expects that the committed curtailment will occur based on the hours as 
confirmed through the DLCP Confirmation notices.  An aggregator has the 
responsibility to produce the demand reduction it confirms.  There is no set 
penalty, except that continued poor performance could result in revocation of 
the DLCP Agreement.  

? Performance Measurement Guidelines
The measurement of performance for each End-Use Load will be performed by the 
Load Aggregators.  Each Load Aggregator will have an ISO approved performance 
measurement plan, which will be used to calculate the DLCP performance.  The 
performance measurement plan shall include the following:
? For interval metered End-Use Loads the Load Aggregator will calculate a 
baseline Load profile.  DLCP performance will be measured by the difference 
between baseline Load profile and the meter read for the hour(s) of 
curtailment.  
? For non-interval metered Loads, DLCP performance will be calculated by 
using a combination of sample measurements, historic data, process controls, 
use of data loggers, and any other performance measurement method approved by 
the ISO.  Load Aggregators shall obtained ISO approval prior to offering DLCP 
for non-interval metered End-Use Loads.  (It should be noted that the ISO 
favors interval meters.)
? DLCP Settlement
Each DLCP Offer for which a DLCP Confirmation was issued by the ISO shall be 
uniquely identified.  Therefore, DLCP Day Ahead and DLCP Day Of offers must 
be separately identified. The Load Aggregators (except for the UDCs) shall 
submit the DLCP Performance Measurement for each confirmed offer by using the 
DLCP website no later than 45 days following the operating day of the DLCP 
Curtailment.  The ISO will calculate the performance payment by simply 
multiplying the DLCP energy price ($500/MWh for DLCP Day Ahead and $750/MWh 
for DLCP Day Of) by the amount of DLCP (in MWs) for each hour of confirmed 
curtailment. For each month the performance payments will be summed up for 
all the confirmed curtailments and paid to the Load Aggregator,s nominated 
Scheduling Coordinator.  The payment will be made to the Scheduling 
Coordinator in accordance to the ISO Payment Calendar timeline.  
The ISO recognizes that UDCs acting as Load Aggregators will have specific 
rules to follow for the settlement of the dispatched curtailment.  The UDCs 
will be responsible for following the settlement rules and regulations set 
forth by the CPUC for the End-Use Loads.

Enron Hits Back At Indian State In Long Dispute Over Power Fees

NEW DELHI -- Enron Corp.'s troubled Indian power project turned up the heat 
in its battle with its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, by taking a formal step toward ending its contract in six months. 
Dabhol Power Corp. also outlined the key points it says should underpin 
future negotiations in the dispute over unpaid bills. 
The fight between Dabhol and Maharashtra is closely watched because the $3 
billion power plant near Bombay is India's largest foreign investment. 
Dabhol, of which Enron owns 65%, says it's owed $48 million in unpaid bills 
by the state electricity board for December and January. However, the 
cash-strapped electricity board counters that Dabhol owes it four billion 
rupees ($85 million) in fines for a service lapse around the same time, which 
Dabhol disputes.
On Saturday, Dabhol issued a preliminary termination notice, the first of 
several prescribed steps toward ending the contract. It triggers a six-month 
cooling-off period. 
""After months of working with Maharashtra State Electricity Board, government 
of Maharashtra and government of India to find solutions, it is apparent that 
MSEB and [Maharashtra] are unwilling to honor their...commitments,"" Dabhol 
said. The statement also blasted India's central government, saying it 
recently failed to send a representative to the first round of talks over the 
dispute. Dabhol holds a guarantee from the central government to cover 
payment defaults. 
Vinay Bansal, chairman of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, said he 
received Dabhol's notice and will respond, although ""we will take some time; 
we have the six-month suspension to work with,"" he said. In the meantime, he 
expects negotiations to continue. The state government has set up a panel, 
the Godbole Committee, to study the contract between Dabhol and the 
electricity board. Dabhol's critics say its rates are unreasonably high. 
Dabhol has said its rates aren't out of line. 
Dabhol's weekend statement also outlined its terms for resolving the problem, 
saying a solution can occur only if the parties contractually bound to 
purchase Dabhol's power -- the electricity board, with guarantees from the 
state and national governments -- ""are willing to either purchase themselves 
or find other creditworthy entities"" willing to buy electricity from Dabhol's 
2,184-megawatt plant. Those requirements ""should form the basis for any 
future discussions,"" Dabhol said, ""and not the Godbole Committee report."" 
Mr. Bansal, electricity-board chairman, responded yesterday that the ""Godbole 
Committee is the forum available for negotiations."" He added that ""all 
discussions should be without prejudice and precondition, and all solutions 
will have to be explored.""

Saudis Signal Bigger Is Better In Gas Project
By Thaddeus Herrick
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

In tapping some of the world's largest oil companies to help build a 
multibillion-dollar natural-gas infrastructure, Saudi Arabia is signaling 
that bigger really is better in competing on the world stage. 
The oil industry has been notable for its huge mergers in recent years as 
Exxon Corp. joined with Mobil Corp., British Petroleum PLC gobbled up two big 
American companies, and TotalFinaElf SA of Paris was formed from three 
European companies. In consolidating, the companies said that they needed 
heft and deep pockets to bid for projects like Saudi Arabia's and match 
effectively with national oil companies.
Friday, Saudi Arabia said it picked just eight companies to participate in 
three projects that are expected to total $25 billion over several years, and 
most of the companies selected have grown by mergers or acquisitions in the 
past two years. 
""This is really a game for the big boys,"" says Roger Diwan, an analyst with 
the Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm in Washington, D.C. Mr. Diwan 
says the largest companies are willing to take bigger risks, have more 
capital and can take a longer view. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. of Irving, Texas, and the Anglo-Dutch Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group each will participate in two of the three projects. Other participants 
include London-based BP PLC, TotalFinaElf and Enron Corp. of Houston, the 
only nonoil company chosen. Chevron Corp. of San Francisco, Rome-based ENI 
SpA and USX-Marathon Group of Pittsburgh made the short list, but weren't 
selected. ""Not everyone wanted this badly,"" Mr. Diwan says. ""But no one 
wanted to be left out."" 
The selection comes more than two years after Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah 
invited major oil companies to return to the kingdom. For Saudi Arabia, the 
gas projects promise to bring in foreign investment that will help create 
jobs for the country's booming work force. 
Oil companies, however, are hopeful that the foot in the door will someday 
lead to a piece of Saudi's oil business as well. Saudi Arabia sits atop more 
than a quarter of the world's oil reserves. While oil has been off limits 
since the mid-1970s, when the Saudis nationalized the industry, the 
international companies are eager to be in position should oil open up again. 
""Ultimately, it's oil that everyone is eyeing,"" said Fadel Gheit, an analyst 
with Fahnestock & Co. 
While Exxon Mobil was tapped to lead a project along the Red Sea coast, 
leaders for the Ghawar and Shaybah projects aren't expected to be chosen 
until June. After that, negotiations on terms for the three ventures will get 
under way; it may be months before final agreements are signed. 
State oil company Saudi Aramco will hold equity in the projects and oversee 
them. Though the projects may include some natural-gas exploration, the main 
thrust of the ventures is to build natural-gas infrastructure, such as 
petrochemical, desalinization and power plants. 
Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles, will join Enron and leader Exxon 
Mobil on the Red Sea project. Both Exxon Mobil and Shell were chosen for the 
marquee $15 billion Ghawar project, along with BP and Phillips Petroleum Co. 
of Bartlesville, Okla. The Shaybah project in the kingdom's Empty Quarter 
will include Shell, TotalFinaElf SA and Conoco Inc. of Houston. 
Chevron, which has agreed to acquire Texaco Inc., said the Saudi gas 
initiative didn't meet the company's business objectives. Chevron bid on the 
Ghawar project and hoped to make exploration and production as well as 
petrochemical investments, said spokesman Fred Gorrell. But apparently such 
investment opportunities weren't offered. Chevron is still thought to be 
well-positioned in Saudi Arabia because of Texaco's exploration and 
production activity in the so-called neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and 
Kuwait. 
Industry analysts say Saudi Arabia is also hoping to give Washington more 
incentive to protect the kingdom from its Middle East adversaries, while at 
the same time allowing the country to keep political distance from the U.S.

Power: Bush Plan, Davis Reactions

Davis is spouting pure hypocrisy as he takes on Reliant Energy (May 17). He 
mentions no word of Enron, another ""gouger."" Why? Because the state public 
employees' retirement system is heavily invested in Enron, and, in fact, 
CalPERS has a billion-dollar business deal with Enron aside from stock. The 
state and Enron are business partners. CalPERS is also invested in many other 
energy companies. If one studies the energy sector of the financial world, 
CalPERS is in the midst of everything. And CalPERS, because of its large 
stock holdings, has the power of influence over corporate boards. 
So Davis, who has spent the past two years raising campaign funds, is really 
just laying down a diversion. The state is an energy gouger and profits from 
it.

Enron pulls out of multi-billion-dollar Gulf gas network

05/21/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

ABU DHABI (AFX) - Enron Corp pulled out of a project to deliver Qatari gas to 
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by selling its 24.5 pct stake in the Dolphin 
Energy Project to its partner, the state-run UAE Offsets Group (UOG). 
No price was disclosed.
UOG will own 75.5 pct of DEL, which was set up in July 2000 to implement the 
gas project, while TotalFinaElf continues to hold the remaining 24.5 pct. 
""The project has evolved into a strong upstream and gas transportation and 
delivery project. Enron is not an upstream company,"" the managing director of 
Enron Middle East explained to reporters. 
DEL's chairman Ahmad Ali al-Sayegh said new partners would be brought into 
the venture to transport 2 bln cubic feet per day (20 mln cubic metres) of 
Qatari natural gas by undersea pipeline to the UAE and on to Oman. 
Patrick Rambaud, a TotalFinaElf vice president, said his company wanted to 
increase its own equity in DEL. ""This project fits perfectly with our 
strategy for long-term presence in these countries,"" he said. 
The first phase of the gas project has a price tag of between 3.5-4 bln usd.

UAE: UPDATE 2-Enron sells stake in Dolphin project.
By Ghaida Ghantous

05/21/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

ABU DHABI, May 21 (Reuters) - U.S. Enron Corp has bowed out of a $3.5 billion 
project to route Qatari gas to the United Arab Emirates and sold its stake in 
Dolphin Energy Ltd (DEL), the project chairman and U.S. firm announced on 
Monday. 
Enron sold its stake to the UAE Offsets Group (UOG) for an undisclosed amount.
Richard Bergsieker, the U.S. firm's Middle East managing director, told a 
news conference in Abu Dhabi that Enron did not believe it could add much to 
the project in its current stage. 
""As the project had evolved into a strong upstream gas supply project and gas 
transport and delivery, we don't believe there is a lot of value that Enron 
can add,"" he explained. 
""The project requires longterm equity investment in upstream and Enron is 
frankly not an upstream company."" 
DEL Chairman Ahmed Ali al-Sayegh had earlier said that Enron had agreed to 
transfer its 24.5 percent stake in Dolphin to UOG for an undisclosed amount, 
raising the UAE firm's stake to 75.5 percent. TotalFinaElf holds the 
remaining stake. 
Patrick Rambaud, TotalFinaElf's senior vice president for the Middle East, 
said his firm has formally asked UOG to increase its own stake in the 
project. Sayegh, however, said UOG was seeking a different partner. 
""We are studying the TotalFinaElf request... (but) there will be another 
partner in the project,"" he said. ""Starting tomorrow, we will begin 
negotiations with the international firms who have shown interest in 
acquiring a state. They are more than eight companies."" 
He refused to name the firms but said ""everybody who is working in the Gulf 
is interested. We are not in a hurry to choose a partner."" 
PRODUCTION SHARING DEAL ON SCHEDULE 
Qatar and DEL in March signed a ""commercial term sheet agreement"" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited $3.5 
billion project. 
The two sides aim to sign a production sharing agreement by the end of the 
third quarter 2001. Sayegh said they would stick to that deadline. ""The 
latest date is mid-September,"" he added. 
Qatar, which sits on the world's third largest gas reserves, is seeking to 
boost its natural gas exports to the Gulf region after investing billions of 
dollars to tap its vast gas riches. 
The gas deal would entitle DEL to develop a tract of Qatar's giant North 
Field and produce up to two billion cubic feet per day (cfd) of gas. UOG is 
to invest $2 billion in developing the tract, drilling and setting up 
production facilities. 
The remaining $1.5 billion would be invested to lay a pipeline and set up 
receiving terminals at Dubai's Jebel Ali and Taweelah in Abu Dhabi. 
First gas is targeted to reach the UAE capital Abu Dhabi by late 2004 or 
early 2005. About one billion to 1.5 billion cfd of Qatari gas would be used 
by utilities in Abu Dhabi and the remainder supplied to Dubai. 
DEL has started inviting local, regional and international companies to 
prequalify for five contracts between May 19-23 following the establishment 
of a technical project team to oversee the implementation of the first 
cross-border gas pipeline project in the Middle East. 
Engineering and construction management firms will have two weeks to submit 
their prequalification statement for each contract after the date of the 
official announcement.

INDIA: India's Enron lenders to lobby for government help.
By Anirban Nag and Sriram Ramakrishnan

05/21/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 21 (Reuters) - Indian lenders want the federal government to 
intervene after a threat by U.S. energy giant Enron Corp, the country's 
largest foreign investor, to walk out of a giant power project put their 
loans in jeopardy. 
""We want the government to step in and resolve the matter with lenders' 
interests in mind. We are continuously monitoring the situation,"" a senior 
official at one of the lenders told Reuters late on Sunday. The official did 
not want to be named.
Local lenders including the Industrial Development Bank of India, ICICI Ltd 
and the country's largest commercial bank, State Bank of India, stand to lose 
if Enron pulls out. 
They have lent $1.4 billion out of the project's total cost of $2.9 billion. 
The rest of the project is being funded through equity and by loans from 
foreign banks led by ABN AMRO 
Shares of the local lenders fell in early trade on Monday with IDBI sliding 
9.39 percent to 24.60 rupees, SBI dipping 1.1 percent to 233.60, while ICICI 
was down six percent to 84.90. The 30-share Bombay index was up 0.17 percent 
at 3,661.19 points. 
The project is now 90 percent complete, but faces an uncertain future after 
Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on Saturday issued a preliminary notice to 
terminate power sales from the plant. 
DPC cited payment defaults by the buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) and non-cooperation from the federal and state government as the 
reason behind the move. The notice leaves the door open for negotiations for 
six months. 
The latest move is likely to further tarnish India's poor image as a place to 
set up power projects. 
The federal government has so far not reacted to the termination notice, 
although analysts say the country needs to tap more foreign investment in the 
power sector. 
OTHER CUSTOMERS 
""This is a complex problem and cannot be solved instantly. The basic issue is 
the cost of power and there needs to be an agreement on a reasonable tariff,"" 
the official said. 
MSEB has said the power produced by DPC is expensive and has refused to buy 
the output from the second phase. The contract between the two signed in the 
mid-1990s had called for MSEB to buy the entire capacity of 2,184 MW. The 
first phase of 740 MW began operations in May 1999. 
Enron has said it is open to negotiations and that the cost of power would 
fall once the second phase of 1,444 MW starts operations. 
The lenders would like the government to clear MSEB's defaults of $48 million 
and also find a buyer for electricity from the second phase. 
But the banker said roping in other customers to buy the second phase's 
output could be difficult to achieve. 
""If the first phase is generating excess power, who will buy the power from 
the second phase?"" he asked. 
TO BLOCK FURTHER LOANS 
The official said Indian lenders had decided to block further loans to the 
second phase till an agreement was reached. The SBI, for instance, had 
sanctioned about 20 billion rupees ($425.9 million), but has disbursed only 
14 billion rupees so far. 
Both ICICI and IDBI officials declined to comment, but sources said the 
domestic lenders were acting together. 
Indian lenders said they were hopeful the matter could be resolved given 
there was a window of six months for negotiation. 
""There is no reason to panic. We are hopeful that talks will resolve the 
issue,"" said the official. 
Indian media speculated at the weekend that the balance sheet of the lenders 
would be under pressure if the dispute was not resolved quickly. ($1 = 46.96 
Indian rupees).

Dabhol project suffers $400-m cost overruns
Anto T Joseph

The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI 
AS IF the current dispute with the Maharashtra government was not enough, the 
Dabhol project now has to deal with cost overruns.
The Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company has experienced a cost overruns to 
the tune of $400 million, taking the total project cost to $3.3 billion. 
DPC, which issued a preliminary termination notice to Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board on Saturday (May 19), is in a fix as both domestic and 
offshore lenders have refused to increase their exposure in the controversial 
power project, the largest-ever foreign direct investment, so far, in India. 
After Indian lenders stopped disbursements as a fallout of a long payment 
crisis, DPC is believed to have scouted for foreign debt, albeit 
unsuccessfully, to maintain the debt-equity status quo at 70:30 ratio. 
DPC's issuance of PTN has compounded the problem. According to the power 
purchase agreement between the MSEB and Enron, issuing a PTN would mean 
fixing a deadline of six months for pulling the final plug on the project. 
""As of now, the FIs have held back $250-million debt to the project. Once the 
PTN is served, DPC can't expect lenders to make any more disbursements, and 
it has almost sealed the fate of the project,"" said a financial institution 
source. 
While the 740-mw phase I is operational, the second phase of 1,144 mw was 
expected to be fully operational by the year-end. One unit of 740 mw (part of 
the second phase) is undergoing trial-runs, and was expected to be 
commercially operational in June. 
Sources said the huge cost overruns had been a major deterrent in project 
completion. Worried by the mounting payment defaults, the EPC (engineering, 
procurement and construction) contractor of the project -- Bechtel -- is 
believed to have threatened to pull out of the project by mid-June. 
The cost overruns stem from devaluation of the rupee vis-a-vis the dollar and 
an increase in equipment cost. Indian FIs are now wary of further cost 
overruns owing to the delay in project execution. 
""Indian FIs, who have contributed 40 per cent of $2.9 billion (earlier 
project cost), had refused to take more exposure. DPC was forced to approach 
foreign lenders for raising funds to cover the cost overruns. They have also 
taken a negative stand,"" said sources. The ABN-AMRO led offshore consortium 
is believed to have refused to contribute any more debt to the project. 
The only way out for DPC is for the promoters to increase their equity 
contributions. Proportionately, Enron, which holds around 65 per cent in DPC, 
will have to shell out a major chunk if this were to happen. 
DPC's move to issue PTN has considerably irked Indian institutions. Lenders 
were planning to cast a confidential vote on PTN this week. However, armed 
with the required mandate from offshore lenders, DPC went ahead and issued 
the PTN.

Last week I was watching the TV news and saw a frightening sight. An angry 
Gray Davis was declaring war on Texas. 
""We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price- gouging us,"" 
the governor said, shaking with something that looked an awful lot like 
emotion. ""Many of those companies are in Texas.""
In typical Davis style, the governor is a little late in declaring war on 
Texas. If he had been president in 1942, he would have spoken of that day of 
infamy in 1941. 
It also was a typical Davis half-measure. He didn't declare war on all of 
Texas, just the Texans who poll badly in California. 
Those would be George W. Bush and his friends and contributors who cut off 
our power, robbed us, and then used us as an example of why the nation needs 
holes punched in Alaska and hundreds of Homer Simpsons put in charge of 
nuclear fuel rods. 
Davis isn't the type to boldly declare unlimited war on all of Texas, 
certainly not ""Austin City Limits,"" chili and the Texans we love, like Willie 
Nelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Charlotte Mailliard Shultz and Willie Brown. 
But Davis had a Texas stereotype in mind as he spoke of the hardscrabble 
hombres in Houston high-rises who are smart and mean and are holding us up 
long-distance. Yep, it's as if Texas is saying to California, ""Your money or 
your lifestyle."" 
Davis said he would retaliate each month by naming a Texas corporation ""pig 
of the month."" 
Yeah, that'll hurt those guys at Reliant Energy and Enron. 
----------------------- 
HAVING GRAY DAVIS ON YOUR SIDE IN A DUSTUP WITH A BUNCH OF TEXANS IS LIKE 
HAVING THE HEAD OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AV CREW ON YOUR SIDE IN A RUMBLE WITH THE 
CRIPS. 
Right now the gashouse gangsters in Houston are having a jeweler make 
14-karat gold pigs they can wear proudly in their lapels while they eat steak 
and laugh at Californians deprived of their sushi because of the loss of 
refrigeration. Texas kids will have bumper stickers on their fuel- 
inefficient scooters saying, ""My dad is a proud pig of the month in 
California."" 
We have to do better than this pig of the month stuff. Slogans won't do when 
you're fighting guys who are cutting off the electricity to read them by. 
Texans have a better slogan, ""Don't mess with Texas,"" and they're a tight 
bunch who won't take kindly to Davis messing with any of their citizens, no 
matter how rich. 
How is Davis going to match ""Don't mess with Texas""? Sorry, but ""Californians 
are people, too"" won't cut it. 
----------------------- 
LONG BEFORE DAVIS DECLARED HALF-WAR ON TEXAS, a couple of readers suggested 
that California retaliate by cutting off the supplies of our products to 
Texas, specifically wine. 
This, of course, is indication of Californians' isolation from mesquite 
reality. There may be six guys in Texas who ever order wine with their 
T-bones, and they're all in Austin. The menus say, ""One: red. Two: white. 
Three rose. Please order by number."" And they all might as well be from 
upstate New York. 
If California were the world's only producer of beer and tequila, then we 
might have a chance of beating Texas by cutting off the essentials of life. 
There's only one way to defeat Texas short of an outright shooting war 
pitting our kids armed by junk-gun manufacturers against their citizens with 
concealed-carry permits. We have to declare an embargo on the one thing that 
Texans really need from California -- entertainment. 
Texans are shutting down our televisions and movie theaters, so we'll cut 
them off from movies and TV shows made in California. Hey, they're all made 
here. Until we get affordable power, it's no sitcoms and no J-Lo for them. 
They won't even get Westerns, since those are shot in parts of California 
blighted enough to look like Texas used to look. Nowadays much of Texas looks 
like Beverly Hills, hold the hills. 
We'll also embargo that branch of entertainment known as California itself. 
At the border crossing into California on I-70, a heavily armed guard will 
peer into each car and truck looking for pointy boots and ask, ""Are you 
carrying any fruit, vegetables or Texans?"" 
Should any Texans turn up, they'll be sent packing toward El Paso, never to 
taste seared ahi, never to see the weirdos on the Sunset Strip, and never to 
feel the natural air-conditioning they can never shut off in San Francisco. 
They'll have to go to Florida if they want to see a guy in a mouse head. 
There's a governor there who won't call them pigs.

		COMMENT & ANALYSIS: India's power struggles: Enron's plight could mark a 
turning point in India's attempts to attract foreign investment, says David 
Gardner: Financial Times; May 21, 2001
By DAVID GARDNER

		The soap opera of Enron in India has reached a critical moment. Once again, 
the US energy company is pitted against the state of Maharashtra, in western 
India. But the twist this time is that Enron is threatening to pull the plug 
on the Dabhol Power Company, the single largest foreign investment in India. 
		It is, at first sight, a wearisome repetition of earlier episodes. The 
Dollars 2.9bn Dabhol deal has been in trouble before. In 1995, a rightwing 
Hindu nationalist coalition of the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata party - now 
the majority of the ruling coalition in New Delhi - ousted the Congress party 
government in Maharashtra and tore up the contract its predecessors had 
signed. The project went ahead after Enron secured a sovereign guarantee from 
the government of India to cover any failure to pay by the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board, Dabhol's sole customer. 
		The first 740MW Dabhol plant is now functioning and a second 1,444MW phase is 
close to completion. But MSEB has been defaulting on payments since last 
December and wishes to renegotiate the contract with Enron, claiming the 
electricity tariffs are unjustifiably high. 
		This weekend Enron began proceedings to terminate the agreement. The move 
triggers an arbitration process that could begin as soon as Wednesday between 
Dabhol and the MSEB. But Enron's actions are beginning to look like the first 
step towards withdrawal from the project, in which it has a 65 per cent 
stake. 
		In the past 18 months, Cogentrix of the US, National Power of the UK, Daewoo 
of South Korea and Electricite de France have all withdrawn from the Indian 
power sector. Of eight so-called ""fast track"" power projects authorised by 
New Delhi in the past decade, Enron's is the only one to have been 
commissioned. 
		Whatever the outcome, a great deal is at stake. The imbroglio could further 
deter a barely detectable trickle of foreign direct investment into India. It 
could blight India's urgent need to double its electricity generation. And it 
raises the question of the extent to which contracts are enforceable in India 
- which alone could raise the risk premium future investors may seek. 
		Unless carefully handled, the controversy could damage India's ambition to 
raise growth by creating an investment-friendly environment, in spite of the 
success of industries such as software and pharmaceuticals. 
		Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, said earlier this month that while his company 
had no immediate plans to sell its Dabhol stake, the dispute ""sends a very 
bad signal to the rest of the world as to the difficulties of investing in 
India, which is not what India needs right now"". 
		Several ministers, including Yashwant Sinha, finance minister, have said they 
see no reason why Enron's experience should deter foreign investors. That is 
true only in the sense that there is very little foreign investment anyway. 
""The government is in denial,"" one minister admits. Publishing foreign direct 
investment figures has become ""an annual embarrassment"", he adds. 
		India received an estimated Dollars 2.6bn in inward investment last year, or 
0.24 per cent of worldwide foreign direct investment flows. Complete figures 
for 1999 show it received Dollars 2.2bn. China, its regional rival, received 
Dollars 63.4bn - including Hong Kong - according to the United Nations. 
		In just as telling a contrast, Electricite de France, which pulled out of 
India after battling for seven years to advance its 1,000MW Bhadravati 
project, is proceeding with a series of power plants in China, Egypt and 
Mexico. 
		""We say we want foreign investment in the power industry and the policy says 
'yes, yes, yes',"" says one civil servant who has soldiered long and hard to 
introduce reform. ""But the practice, I'm afraid, is 'no, no, no'."" 
		The Enron project, its critics say, is particular. Although Dabhol's power 
purchasing agreement with the MSEB is confidential, it is widely believed to 
embody a ""hurdle rate of return"" - the after-tax, internal rate of return on 
equity in dollars - in excess of 20 per cent. The normal rate sought by the 
dwindling investors in India's power industry is 16-18 per cent. 
		In addition, Dabhol's charges per kilowatt hour are higher than anticipated 
because its ""load factor"", or capacity usage, is much lower. The financially 
strapped MSEB is buying less and Enron's contract allows it to apply variable 
charges over the fewer units of output, raising the cost. 
		There is an important sense, however, in which all this is academic. India's 
state electricity boards are de facto bankrupt. Whether the cost per unit is 
one rupee or 10, they cannot pay. 
		The problem is user charges. Most Indian farmers get free power, much of 
India's urban middle class steals power and too many of India's populist 
politicians are frightened of agreeing on a minimum common tariff that might 
begin restoring the solvency of the state electricity boards and thus 
facilitate investment. 
		Many industrial users that could pay, angered by cross-subsidies they are 
charged for the inefficient system, have switched to secure ""captive"" 
capacity of their own, an estimated 10,000MW of which is now in place. While 
India needs to boost installed capacity by about 100,000MW by 2010, with no 
one to pay for electricity a mere 464MW was commissioned last year, according 
to Power Line, an industry newsletter. 
		""It is self-defeating to try to attract an Enron without first putting your 
house in order,"" one minister says. ""It was always obvious that within the 
present set-up Maharashtra would never be able to pay."" 
		Hari Dhaul, head of the Independent Power Producers of India, says restoring 
the solvency of ""the (state electricity boards) is priority number one; 
unless we do that, all talk of power and infrastructure is academic."" 
		The government made a start when Mr Sinha, in the February budget, announced 
a still-to-be-determined package of soft loans for states that reform their 
electricity boards and begin introducing more realistic tariffs. But since 
then the government has floundered over a series of scandals - not a 
propitious climate for reform. 
		The Enron case has the potential to become, if not another scandal, at least 
a blight. As a senior executive at a foreign power company puts it: ""India 
needs modern infrastructure if it is ever to become a modern country. It 
needs foreign investment to do part of it but that will only come if the 
perception becomes that it is easy to invest in India.""

Enron Withdraws From U.A.E.'s $2 Bln Gas Project (Update1)
2001-05-21 06:04 (New York)

Enron Withdraws From U.A.E.'s $2 Bln Gas Project (Update1)

     (Add comments from Dolphin's chairman in the second
paragraph, and background throughout)

     Abu Dhabi, May 21 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., the world's
biggest energy trader, withdrew from Abu Dhabi's $2 billion
project to import natural gas from Qatar and sell it to other
Persian Gulf emirates, the project's chief said.
     The Houston-based company, which had held almost 25 percent
of Dolphin Energy Ltd., will sell its stake back to the Abu Dhabi
government, said Ahmed al-Sayegh, the chairman of state-
controlled Dolphin,
     ``We have started negotiations with a number of international
players keen to become shareholders'' in the company, he said.
     An Enron spokeswoman declined to comment.
    The announcement comes two months after Dolphin, a venture
between Abu Dhabi, Enron and Total Fina Elf SA, agreed with Qatar
to develop its North Dome field, the world's largest natural-gas
deposit, and build a pipeline under the Persian Gulf to the United
Arab Emirates and Oman.
     Governments in these Gulf states plan to use the gas for
industrial development, after a collapse in oil prices in 1998
reinforced their need to reduce dependence on crude oil sales.
     Abu Dhabi had owned 51 percent of Dolphin, with Enron and
Total splitting the remainder. The development of the Qatari gas
field will require investment of $2 billion to $3 billion, while
the pipeline to Abu Dhabi costs another $1 billion to $2 billion,
Dolphin has said.

                         Mystery

     Al-Sayegh didn't say why Enron had withdrawn from the
project. This is the second time in five years that the U.S.
company has withdrawn from a multibillion natural gas project
involving Qatar. Enron earlier pulled out of negotiations to build
a plant for turning gas into liquid form and exporting it to
India.
     Gas from the North Dome field, discovered in 1971, has so far
been liquefied and exported by tanker to Asia. Shipping by
pipeline is cheaper.
     Enron's shares have fallen 34 percent this year to close on
Friday at $54.90.



Lenders to Enron's Indian Unit Hoping for Solution (Update1)
2001-05-21 04:38 (New York)

Lenders to Enron's Indian Unit Hoping for Solution (Update1)

     (Adds comment from lender in seventh paragraph, fund manager
comment in ninth paragraph, updates share price in last.)

     Mumbai, May 21 (Bloomberg) -- State Bank of India, ABN Amro
and others that loaned money to a unit of Enron Corp. of the U.S.
are hoping a settlement will still be reached to prevent the $3
billion project from being scrapped in a row over unpaid bills.
     Dabhol Power, which borrowed about $2 billion from local and
international lenders to build a 2,184 megawatt power plant in
western Maharashtra state, issued a notice Saturday saying it
would cancel its power supply contract with the local government
because of unpaid bills.
     ``The notice does not mean that the project is off,'' said
Janki Ballabh, chairman of State Bank of India, the country's
biggest commercial bank and one of the largest lenders to the
project. ``All parties are making attempts to find an acceptable
solution.''
     Indian banks, which made rupee loans worth $1 billion to
Dabhol, are at the most risk from a possible termination of the
project as their loans were not guaranteed by the federal
government. They were seen as safe because of Enron's 65 percent
stake in the project. Should the world's largest power supplier
walk away from its investment, the risk of these loans turning bad
would increase.
     Foreign currency loans, made by lenders including ABN Amro
Holding NV and Bank of America Corp as well as State Bank of
India, are guaranteed.
     ``I won't call it a panic situation, though lenders including
us have to keep a watch,'' said Ballabh at SBI, who declined to
specify a figure for the bank's exposure. He also said it was
premature to comment on the impact of a possible termination of
the Dabhol project on the bank's balance sheet.
     ICICI Ltd., the country's second-largest lender to companies,
is ``covered back-to-back by state government guarantees,'' said
Kalpana Morparia, executive director at ICICI.
     Still, investors viewed the termination notice as bad news
for lenders, which saw their share prices fall.
     ``The banks will take a big hit on their balance sheet if the
Dabhol project is stalled,'' said Deepak Malhotra, who helps
manage $88 million in assets at Max India Ltd. in New Delhi.
     The so-called ``preliminary termination notice'' is being
seen as an attempt to force the central and Maharashtra state
governments to the negotiating table to resolve a standoff over
payments to the company, which is owed 3 billion rupees ($64
million) for power supplies in December and January.




                         Negotiating Ploy

     The notice was issued so that all parties to the dispute come
to the negotiating table, said an official at ICICI, who requested
anonymity.
     The fate of Dabhol, the biggest single foreign investment in
India, holds the key to further overseas investment in India's
power industry. Four foreign power companies, including
Electricite de France, Europe's largest, have pulled out of Indian
power projects worth $3 billion, citing long delays and the slow
pace of reforms.
     A failure of further negotiations may lead Enron to pull out
of the country. Parties involved in the project have six months
from the issuance of the preliminary termination notice to reach a
settlement. In case the project is scrapped, the Maharashtra
electricity board, the state government and the central government
face 170 billion rupees in liabilities.
     ``It's too big a project to fall off the ground,'' said
Sachin Sawrikar, fund manager at SBI Fund Management Ltd. ``If
Enron does back out, another promoter may step in to take over the
project and take over the liabilities after negotiations.''

                         Meeting Wednesday

     To end the impasse, DPC and the Maharashtra government plan
to meet on Wednesday. Dabhol said that if the government of India
stays away from the meeting, like it did the last time on May 11,
and if the federal and state governments don't come up with fresh
proposals ``further meetings will not be productive.''
     The Maharashtra State Electricity Board says it hasn't paid
the money it owes as the price of Dabhol's electricity is more
than double the rate it pays for power from other Indian
generators. Under the terms of the supply agreement it agreed to
pay a fee whether it used all the electricity or not, which has
meant rates have risen as high as nine times the price of power
bought from alternative sources such as Tata Power Co.
     The defaults spurred Dabhol to invoke payment guarantees by
the Maharashtra state and federal governments. The company on
April 25 authorized its management to cancel contracts to sell
power to the board.
     ICICI shares fell 4.25 rupees, or 4.75 percent, to 85.15
rupees on the Mumbai stock exchange. Industrial Development Bank
of India Ltd., the largest lender to Enron, fell 2 rupees, or 7.4
percent, to 25.15 rupees while State Bank shares were down 3.7
rupees, or 1.57 percent, to 232.5 rupees.


State Bank, ICICI Decline as Enron Plans to Pull Out of India
2001-05-21 03:02 (New York)


     Mumbai, May 21 (Bloomberg) -- State Bank of India and ICICI
Ltd., lenders to Enron Corp.'s Dabhol Power Co., fell after Enron
served a notice on India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board to
end its power supply contract because of unpaid dues. The state
electricity board owes 3 billion rupees ($64 million) to Dabhol
for supplying power in December and January. ``The banks will take
a big hit on their balance sheet if the Dabhol project is
stalled,'' said Deepak Malhotra, who helps manage $88 million in
assets at Max India Ltd. in New Delhi.
     State Bank of India, India's biggest commercial bank, fell
2.7 rupees, or 1.1 percent, to 233.5 rupees after earlier falling
as much as 2 percent. ICICI Ltd., India's second-largest lender,
fell as much as 7.1 percent. ICICI declined 4.35 rupees, or 4.9
percent, to 85.05 in recent trading on the Mumbai Stock Exchange.
Industrial Development Bank of India Ltd., India's biggest lender,
fell as much as 2.75 rupees, or 10 percent, to 24.4 rupees. IDBI
shares dropped 2 rupees, or 7.4 percent, to 25.15 in recent
trading.


ANZ Investment's Rangnekar on Loans to Power Companies: Comment

ANZ Investment's Rangnekar on Loans to Power Companies: Comment

     New Delhi, May 21 (Bloomberg) -- Abhay Rangnekar, director
and head of project finance and corporate advisory services at ANZ
Investment Bank in India, speaks on the impact on lending to power
companies after Enron's Dabhol Power Co. served notice it may
cancel its power supply contract with the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board.
     Dabhol on Saturday started a procedure to end its contract by
serving a ``preliminary termination notice'' on the electricity
board, with which it has been in dispute over 3 billion rupees
($64 million) of unpaid power bills for December and January.


     ``Pace of investments in the power sector is already slow.
It'll get slower.''

     ``Lender sentiment has definitely been affected. Making sure
that the contracts are watertight is not enough anymore'' for any
private power project.

     ``Lenders will need to ensure that power projects will have a
continuing ability to offer competitive tariffs, which would
(give) incentive (to) the state electricity boards to dispatch
them.''

     ``Lenders will also be cautious about accepting the demand-
supply estimates in different states.

     ``The track record of state electricity boards in paying
private power producers will also be stringently monitored.''

     ANZ Investment is one of the four global coordinators that
helped raise overseas loans for the $2.8 billion second phase of
the Dabhol project."

By Jason Leopold 

Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Federal energy regulators may investigate whether the operator of California's wholesale electricity market has been manipulating its power-purchasing practices to reduce the costs of power the state purchased under long-term contracts, according to documents obtained Friday by Dow Jones Newswires Friday. 

At issue is whether the California Independent System Operator has violated its own market rules by purchasing expensive power secured by the state under contracts rather than cheaper power available in the spot market. The state's need to sell off surplus power secured under those contracts has proven embarrassing for Gov. Gray Davis, who signed $43 billion in deals to head off a summer of spiking prices and blackouts that never materialized. 

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will hold a meeting in California Monday to address generators' complaints. The energy companies say that the California ISO's purchasing decisions are difficult to comprehend and out of line with the market, according to a letter sent by Andrea Wolfman, lead FERC counsel for market oversight and enforcement. 

The letter was sent to the ISO, the California Department of Water Resources - which has been buying power in lieu of the state's struggling utilities since mid-January - and several generators, all of which were to attend the meeting. 

""Recently we have become concerned that the scheduling and dispatch procedures of the California ISO, as they have had to change in the last nine months, are not well understood or are not well suited to the current market structure,"" Wolfman said in her letter. ""The purpose of the meeting is to develop agreement between the ISO and those that participate in the scheduling and dispatch (generators, utilities, CDWR) on appropriate practices and procedures."" 

ISO Procedures Need Explaining -FERC 

The ISO's main responsibility is keeping power supply and demand in balance on the state's electrical grid. As part of that job, the ISO determines which power plants to call into service and which suppliers to buy power from. 

If the ISO can't explain how it makes its decisions, FERC may conduct an audit of the organization and investigate the possibility it has manipulated the market, Wolfman's office said. 

""As discussed, FERC may schedule a technical conference and operational audit of CAISO,"" a second letter from FERC's market oversight and enforcement division states. ""This unprecedented examination of CAISO operations could lead to the belief that complaints by generators of market manipulation and other practices by the ISO should be investigated."" 

The ISO's operating rules generally call for it to purchase the cheapest power first. 

""The information that (generators) have provided all leads to a theory that the CAISO is manipulating the market in order to purchase surplus DWR power at high prices and protect Gov. Davis from political embarrassment,"" the second letter says. 

The ISO has said only that the market isn't operating as intended, and declined to answer other questions about the allegations or discuss Monday's meeting.

That's because, according to the allegations, the ISO is letting DWR supply expensive power into the market as ""out-of-market"" purchases that aren't averaged into the real-time prices that ISO market participants see. 

DWR continues to buy out-of-market power regularly at the ISO's request, DWR operations chief Pete Garris has said, but those purchases are being made in the spot market and are never being satisfied by power from DWR's long-term contracts. 

The out-of-market purchases appear to be expensive, however. According to the ISO's August market report, the average out-of-market price for peak hours was $55.90 a megawatt-hour, compared with $26.49/MWh on the ISO computerized market. Brokered prices of western electricity have been lower than the out-of-market prices for months. 

None of the companies mentioned was willing to comment on the record. 

The meeting is scheduled to be held at the ISO's headquarters in Folsom, Calif., and representatives from power producers, utilities and the state are expected to attend. FERC will serve as facilitator, Wolfman said. The meeting isn't open to the public. 

The meeting will begin with a presentation by the ISO on its practices and operational procedures, followed by adjustments that may be needed to improve the market. 

""The objective is to develop a written set of procedures that is agreed to by all the market participants and that is consistent with good utility practices,"" Wolfman said in the letter.
